            "> atlanta, georgia cnn terrorism, a slow economy and rising gas prices are issues that can keep american voters awake at night. undecided voters gathered at emory university, where dr. drew westen studies how brains react to messages. political strategists know that the most successful candidates are masters at capitalizing on fears such as these, and that can make a huge difference at the polls. in 1964, lyndon johnson was running for president against conservative barry goldwater when his campaign unleashed the daisy ad. it showed a little girl counting as she plucked a daisy, charmingly mixing up her numbers. then a baritone voice takes over, counting down to an overwhelming nuclear explosion. it is followed with a warning that the stakes are too high not to vote for johnson. the ad, which ran only once, was so chilling and effective, analysts say, it helped johnson win the presidency by one of the widest margins in u.s. history. cnn recently gathered eight undecided voters to see how they would respond to attack ads and how the ads might affect their choices. they met at emory university in atlanta, georgia, where psychologist drew westen studies how brains react to candidates messages. westen, who wrote the political brain, said fear based attack ads are effective because they tap into a voter s subconscious. those kinds of gut level reactions tell us things like, i do not feel like this person is telling us the truth, westen said. unless someone is a really good con man, those reactions are extremely helpful. the conscious brain processes only a tiny percent of information. westen and his business partner, joel weinberger, have created software, through their company thinkscan, that looks into a voter s subconscious. the software does this by measuring people s reaction time to certain words after they watch attack ads. the undecided voters in cnn s group watched the ads and were then asked to identify the color of words such as weak, inexperienced and terrorist. if they hesitated, even for one thousandth of a second, before they clicked on the color that corresponded with the word, weinberger said, it meant the word had an impact. if the word is on their mind, if the word was activated, it will slow them down, weinberger said. westen predicted that the undecided voters would say they did not like the ads and that the ads had no impact on them. he was right. the group watched hillary clinton s 3 a.m. campaign ad, which was intended to make voters question barack obama s experience. viewers said that the ad was fear mongering and that it did not make them think clinton was a stronger leader than obama. but the data, westen said, showed that their brains reacted differently. voters had the greatest hesitation with words like weak and lightweight during the color test. westen said this meant the ad made them question obama s readiness. the purpose, too, is to make him seem scary, dangerous. you need to be afraid of this guy as president, westen said. that message unconsciously got through. the undecided voters also watched an ad attacking john mccain for saying the u.s. could be in iraq for the next 100 years. after watching the ad, the group gave it a thumbs down. but researchers said the data showed that it left them feeling mccain has poor judgment and is too close to president bush. the results were identical when the same test was given to a much larger group of 100 voters. this happens because the ads trigger a response in the part of the brain called the amygdala, which experiences emotions such as fear. when it is aroused, it overrides logic, according to westen. despite the ability of attack ads to affect voters subconscious thinking, westen cautions that fear based ads are risky because they can backfire. what advice does westen have for presidential hopefuls they should make voters feel inspired by them and worried about their opponent at the same time, westen said. it works. \n",

            "> washington cnn vice president joe biden brushed aside recent criticism by predecessor dick cheney that moves by the obama administration had put the united states at risk, telling cnn on tuesday that the former vice president was dead wrong. vice president joe biden sits down for an interview with cnn s gloria borger and wolf blitzer on tuesday. i do not think cheney is out of line, but he is dead wrong, he told cnn s wolf blitzer. this administration the last administration left us in a weaker posture than we have been any time since world war ii less regarded in the world, stretched more thinly than we ever have been in the past, two wars under way, virtually no respect in entire parts of the world. ... i guarantee you we are safer today, our interests are more secure today than they were any time during the eight years of the bush administration. in an interview with cnn s john king last month, cheney said president obama had been making some choices that in my mind will raise the risk to the american people of another attack. biden said former president bush had not been fully aware of the country s position in the world. watch biden lash out on bush and cheney . i remember president bush saying to me one time in the oval office, and he was a great guy, enjoyed being with him. he said to me, he said, well, joe, he said, i m a leader. and i said, mr. president, turn around and look behind you. no one s following. people are beginning to follow the united states again as a consequence of our administration. ... i think the biggest thing we are doing is, i am operating in concert with the president, he said. there are not there are look, everybody talks about how powerful cheney was. his power weakened america, in my view. but he did not deny reports of disagreement within the obama administration as well, over the president s plan to widen involvement in afghanistan. a report last week said biden had warned about the possibility of getting into a quagmire, while military advisers pushed for more troops. watch more on obama s afghanistan plan . well, look. without commenting specifically on who took what position, there was a healthy debate. there is a healthy debate within our administration. the vice president said that he condemned a new afghan law that would allow men to rape their wives, but that those issues were not the focus of the u.s. presence in that nation. i am not prepared to send american troops to die for that, he said. as the president made an unannounced visit to baghdad, iraq, on tuesday, biden said that he had no concerns that a recent uptick in violence in iraq might affect plans to withdraw most u.s. troops from that country by the summer of 2010. i m not worried about that at all. we will draw down along the timeline we suggested, the vice president said. watch the full interview . also not a concern for biden the possibility of an israeli strike on iran s nuclear facilities. the vice president said he was not worried that israel s new government, under prime minister benjamin netanyahu, would order such an attack. i do not believe that prime minister netanyahu would do that. i think he would be ill advised to do that. and so my level of concern is no different than it was a year ago. a day after north korea s rocket test sparked alarm from world leaders, biden called for a tougher response from moscow and beijing. what i would like to see is a strong condemnation and a united effort on the part of the chinese, russians in the six party talks to say, enough is enough, there will be greater sanctions, we will squeeze down even harder on north korea, he said. he added that china could do a great deal more, although he was uncertain it would. i think this puts the onus on china and russia and south korea and japan, et cetera, along with us, to be bolder in our condemnation. on the domestic front, biden said that the administration s economic plan would prevent up to 4 million jobs from being lost and stabilize the economy, but that it will take at least another year before you start to see employment, and in the meantime, jobs will continue to disappear. watch biden answer ireporters questions . there will be an additional job loss. ... you are not going to see reports this calendar year saying there was no job loss this month. that is not going to happen. ...there will continue to be job losses the remainder of this year. the question is will they continually go down before they begin to rebound, and employment we go down to zero job loss and back to employment. he said it was too premature to begin discussing another stimulus package, though he has not ruled one out.\n",

            "> london, england cnn when hiv positive winnie sseruma was invited to speak on the subject at the united nations in new york last june, she never expected that her condition would prevent her from obtaining a visa. hiv positive winnie sseruma was repeatedly questioned before being allowed into the united states. winnie sseruma has been living with the disease for over 20 years. preparing for her trip, uk based winnie discovered that the united states was one of 70 countries worldwide that either banned or restricted inbound travel for people with hiv. i was told i needed to come to the u.s. embassy for an interview and bring a doctor s letter stating i was fit to travel, sseruma, hiv coordinator for charity christian aid, told cnn. at first, the embassy told me that the first available appointment for my interview would be at a date past the u.n. high level meeting i was meant to attend. only when the u.n. intervened on sseruma s behalf was she granted an earlier interview date. sseruma was relieved when she finally received her visa on time. but the hurdles were far from over. at the airport in new york, sseruma was detained twice for further questioning. it was so humiliating, sseruma said. the immigration officers were asking me very personal questions about my health. a month after sseruma s ordeal, the u.s. senate passed the re authorization of president bush s emergency plan for aids relief pepfar , including an amendment to the ban on travel and immigration for hiv positive non citizens. but the united states travel ban still remains in effect, and will continue to be the law until the department of health and human services hhs modifies its regulations. fifty eight members of congress have sent a letter to the hhs, urging them to take action. russia also places restrictions on travelers with hiv. affected visitors are not permitted to stay in the country for more than three months. anyone applying for a visa for long term stay must present a certificate stating that they are hiv negative. the russian embassy s spokesperson in london told cnn no changes to the ban were currently being considered and declined to comment further. crusading against these bans is ctrl.alt.shift, a uk based organization that attempts to engage youth to combat global and social injustices. the organization argues that there is no public health rationale for restricting liberty of movement or choice of residence on the grounds of hiv status. are these laws outmoded what do you think tell us in the sound off below. the fight against stigmas associated with hiv and aids has been widely adopted by the organization s young members. many are joining ctrl.alt.shift s protests across london. last week, following two protests at the embassies of saudi arabia and south korea both countries ban hiv positive travelers from entering their borders the organization launched its third protest in front of the russian embassy in london. the level of proliferation of the hiv virus in countries that do not implement bans on hiv travelers is proof that these bans have no impact whatsoever, except for reinforcing the stigma, said neil boorman, ctrl.alt.shift s project manager. boorman told cnn that the bans and restrictions further the spread of the epidemic by driving the issue underground and force people to lie about their health on visa applications. tinchy strider, a 22 year old british rap artist, was also present at the protest. i m here because many young people are not aware of these issues, but if they knew these bans existed, they would want to do something about it, tinchy explained. eighteen year old sian anderson agrees. anderson believes it is bad enough to live with hiv and that these regulations make life even harder. some people are completely not at fault, they might have gotten the virus through blood transfusion and russia does not take that into consideration, anderson said. science has moved on from the days where hiv was an unknown virus. now the world needs to move on too, sseruma said. stigma remains our biggest challenge. \n",
