0,UK orders Chinese firm to sell Welsh tech plant,"The takeover of Britain's largest microchip plant by a Chinese-owned company must be reversed, the UK government has said.Newport Wafer Fab was acquired by Dutch-based technology company Nexperia, a subsidiary of Shanghai listed Wingtech, in July 2021.However, Nexperia must now sell 86% of its stake ""to mitigate the risk national security"" following a review.The firm said it was ""shocked"" and would appeal against the decision.The semiconductors, or chips, made there are used in modern electronics ranging from smartphones to household equipment and cars.The deal came under scrutiny amid an ongoing global shortage of computer chips which has been exacerbated by the pandemic.Concerns were raised that the home-grown technology, considered to be of strategic importance, would become more accessible to China under Nexperia.In its decision, the UK government said the takeover of Newport Wafer Fab created two risks to national security.The first related to Nexperia's development of the Newport site, which the government said could ""undermine UK capabilities"" in producing compound semiconductors.The second, the plant's location as part of a semiconductor cluster on the Duffryn industrial estate, could ""facilitate access to technological expertise and know-how"". It said the close links that existed in Newport ""may prevent the cluster being engaged in future projects relevant to national security"". The Newport plant employs more than 500 people and, at the time of the takeover, was producing about 35,000 wafers a year.The UK government had faced pressure to intervene, not least from the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee which said that Nexperia's takeover represents the sale of ""one of the UK's prized assets"" to a strategic competitor and potentially compromised national security. A report in April said an investigation pledged by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson by the National Security Advisor had not happened.However, the decision was called in by the then-Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng in May on national security grounds.It was left to his successor Grant Shapps to announce the decision following delays due to the changes in prime minister and the cabinet. Nexperia said it did not accept the national security concerns and criticised the UK government for not entering ""meaningful dialogue"". Toni Versluijs, head of its UK operations, said: ""We are genuinely shocked. The decision is wrong, and we will appeal to overturn this divestment order to protect the over 500 jobs at Newport. ""The decision is disproportionate given the remedies Nexperia has proposed. It is wrong for the employees, for the UK semiconductor industry, for the UK economy and for the UK taxpayer - who could now be faced with a bill of over Â£100m for the fallout from this decision.""We rescued an investment-starved company from collapse. We have repaid taxpayer loans, secured jobs, wages, bonuses and pensions and agreed to spend more than Â£80m on equipment upgrades. The deal was publicly welcomed by the Welsh government.""",The UK government says Nexperia's takeover of Newport Wafer Fab creates national security risks.,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-63656816,/news/business
1,"Work long hours or leave, Musk tells Twitter staff","Elon Musk has told Twitter staff that they must commit to working ""long hours at high intensity"" or else leave the company, according to reports.In an email to staff, the social media firm's new owner said workers should agree to the pledge if they wanted to stay, the Washington Post reported.Those who do not sign up by Thursday will be given three months' severance pay, Mr Musk said.The BBC has contacted Twitter for comment.In his email to staff, also seen by The Guardian, Mr Musk said that Twitter ""will need to be extremely hardcore"" in order to succeed.""This will mean working long hours at high intensity. Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade,"" he said.Workers were told that they needed to click on a link by 17:00 EST on Thursday, if they want to be ""part of the new Twitter"".He added: ""Whatever decision you make, thank you for your efforts to make Twitter successful.""The world's richest man has already announced half of Twitter's staff are being let go, after he bought the company in a $44bn (Â£38.7bn) deal.Mr Musk said he had ""no choice"" over the cuts as the company was losing $4m (Â£3.51m) a day. He has blamed ""activist groups pressuring advertisers"" for a ""massive drop in revenue"".A host of top Twitter executives have also stepped down following his purchase of the firm.Last week, the entrepreneur told Twitter staff that remote working would end and ""difficult times"" lay ahead, according to reports.In an email to staff, the owner of the social media firm said workers would be expected in the office for at least 40 hours a week, Bloomberg reported.Mr Musk added that there was ""no way to sugar coat the message"" that the slowing global economy was going to hit Twitter's advertising revenues.But tech investor Sarah Kunst said the real reason Twitter is facing difficulties is because Mr Musk's takeover has saddled the company with debt. His behaviour since the takeover has also led some advertisers to pause their spending, she said. ""He's now trying to inflict that pain and uncertainty on the employees,"" she said.She added that there was a question mark over how enforceable Mr Musk's email about hours to staff really was.""Can you just send an email to staff who already work for you, and just unilaterally change their working contract? That remains to be seen.""Mr Musk himself has been sleeping at Twitter in recent weeks, even while leading electric carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX.He described his work habits in a US court on Wednesday, where he appeared to defend the eye-popping $56bn pay package he received from electric carmaker Tesla in 2018.""I pretty much work all the time, with rare exceptions."" he said. In response to questioning, he later added that the ""fundamental organisational restructuring"" at Twitter would be complete by the end of this week.Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, warned it was further evidence that Twitter's culture had ""dramatically changed"" with Mr Musk at the helm.""Elon Musk is not going to be doing candlelight dinners and playing ping pong in Twitter's cafeteria and this is a shock to the system,"" he said.""But he also needs to play nice in the sandbox because if key Twitter engineers and developers leave, this will be a major void in the Twitter ecosystem,"" he warned. ""There's a careful balance ahead for him, in this tightrope act.""Do you work long hours either willingly or because you feel you have no choice?

2,UK Chancellor to unveil spending cuts and tax rises,"Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will pledge to face into the economic ""storm"", as he is expected to confirm widespread spending cuts and tax rises.He will say ""difficult decisions"" are needed to tackle soaring prices and limit mortgage costs. But he faces a potential backlash from some Tory MPs who oppose big tax hikes. The BBC understands the state pension and benefits will rise with prices but energy support is expected to be scaled back from April. Labour said the country was ""being held back by 12 years of Tory economic failure and wasted opportunities"", with working people ""paying the price"".  The BBC has spoken to people in Whitehall and Parliament about what is likely to be in Mr Hunt's Autumn Statement, although some decisions could change at the last minute.The final figures will be published as the statement is delivered but it is expected that around 55% of the measures will be spending cuts and 45% will be tax rises. This is likely to equate to around Â£30bn in spending cuts and Â£24bn in tax rises. The chancellor is likely to argue that this is not a return to the 2010 Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government's policy of austerity, with the balance of spending cuts to tax rises 80% to 20% under then-Chancellor George Osborne. The government argues the measures are needed to fill a so-called fiscal black hole - the gap between what the government raises and spends.However, some have questioned how reliable the forecasts are and the political decisions ministers are making. The freezing of levels at which people pay various taxes will be a big theme of the statement. As a result of inflation and pay increases, people will end up paying more tax. The threshold when the highest earners start paying the top rate of tax will be lowered to Â£125,000 from Â£150,000. With inflation - the rate at which prices rise - now running at a 41-year high, many departments will see their budgets squeezed with below-inflation increases. But it is expected the health budget will be protected and increase in real terms - even when price rises are taken into account. The government will also save cash by scaling back support with energy bills. The Treasury is likely to say an Energy Price Guarantee will remain in place - but at a higher level. That means millions of households will see their bills go up by hundreds of pounds a year from April.Under the current scheme a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity is expected to pay Â£2,500 annually. This figure is likely to rise to just over Â£3,000 but without the intervention the typical household bill would have hit Â£4,000. Universal support payments will end but there will be targeted support for those on low incomes and pensioners, with the scaling back of the Energy Price Guarantee helping to fund targeted support for some eight million low-income households.The energy industry - including energy generators - will also be hit with a significantly expanded windfall tax to help pay for the support. The BBC understands the state pension and benefits will rise with inflation - although this has not been officially confirmed. An increased National Living Wage, from the current level of Â£9.50 an hour for over-23s, will also be confirmed. After unexpected announcements in Mr Hunt's predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng's ill-fated mini-budget, no big surprises are expected from the chancellor. Mr Hunt has already reversed almost all the tax rises announced in the mini-budget in a bid to stabilise financial markets. Unlike Mr Kwarteng, Mr Hunt will publish independent forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) alongside his statement. The forecasts are expected to paint a grim picture, after the Bank of England warned the country is set for its longest recession since records began.In his Autumn Statement, Mr Hunt is expected to say: ""We are taking difficult decisions to deliver strong public finances and help keep mortgage rates low, but our plan also protects our long-term economic growth.""At the same time, we protect the vulnerable, because to be British is to be compassionate.""He is set to add that the UK was not ""immune"" to the global economic crisis ""but with this plan for stability, growth and public services - we will face into the storm"".However, some Tory MPs on the right of the party have already expressed concern about the prospect of tax rises. Former cabinet minister Esther McVey has said putting up taxes is the ""last thing"" a Conservative government should be doing. On Wednesday, she warned she would not support tax rises unless the ""unnecessary vanity project"" of HS2 was scrapped. Simon Clarke, who was in Ms Truss's cabinet, warned Mr Hunt not to ""throw the baby out with the bathwater and overcorrect"" by imposing too many tax hikes.""I hope they will strike a balance which leans much more to spending reductions than tax rises to balance the books,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. But former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb said he feared spending cuts could lead to ""real risks to the quality of public services"".He told the BBC the state pension and benefits ""absolutely"" need to rise with inflation and that the Energy Price Guarantee needed to be broader than just helping pensioners and people on benefits. He added that he was confident Mr Hunt would make ""the right decisions"". Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the UK needed ""fairer choices for working people and a proper plan for growth"". ""Britain has so much potential but we are falling behind on the global stage, while mortgages, food and energy costs all go up and up,"" she said. ","Pensions and benefits will rise with prices but energy support is expected to be scaled back, the BBC understands.",https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63656522,/news/business
3,What is behind the big tech companies' job cuts?,"The first sign of job cuts at Amazon came from LinkedIn posts from laid-off employees.Then, Amazon's devices boss, Dave Limp, announced: ""It pains me... We will lose talented Amazonians from the devices & services org"".Across the tech industry, at firms like Twitter, Meta, Coinbase and Snap, workers have announced they are ""seeking new opportunities"".Worldwide, more than 120,000 jobs have been lost, according to the Layoffs.fyi website, which tracks tech job cuts.Different firms cut employees for different reasons but there are common themes.As our lives moved online during the pandemic, the tech giants' businesses boomed, and executives believed the good times - for them - would continue to roll.Meta, for example, took on more than 15,000 people in the first nine months of this year.Now executives announcing cuts have said they miscalculated.""I made the decision to significantly increase our investments,"" chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees, as he laid off 13% of them.""Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.""Online adverts are the chief source of income for many tech firms, but for the advertising business, dark clouds have been gathering. Firms have faced growing opposition to intrusive advertising practices. For example, Apple made it harder to track people's online activity and sell that data to advertisers. And as the economy ran into trouble, many firms slashed their online advertising budgets.In the financial technology sector, rising interest rates have also hit companies.""It's been a really a disappointing quarter of earnings for many of the big tech companies,"" said technology analyst Paolo Pescatore of PP Foresight. ""No-one's immune.""Even Apple has signalled caution, with chief executive Tim Cook saying the firm was ""still hiring"", but only on a ""deliberate basis."" Amazon attributed its job cuts to an ""unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment"" forcing it to prioritize on what mattered most to customers.""As part of our annual operating planning review process, we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change,"" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. ""As we've gone through this, given the current macro-economic environment (as well as several years of rapid hiring), some teams are making adjustments, which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary. We don't take these decisions lightly, and we are working to support any employees who may be affected.""Investors have also piled on the pressure to cut costs, accusing firms of being bloated and slow to respond to signs of slowdown.In an open letter to Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, activist investor Sir Christopher Hohn urged the firm to slash jobs and pay.Alphabet had to be more disciplined about costs, he wrote, and cut losses from projects like its self-driving car company, Waymo.Elon Musk is certainly of the view that there is room to cut costs at his latest investment, Twitter, which has struggled to either turn a profit or attract new users.Added to that, many commentators argue Mr Musk paid over the odds for the firm, and the pressure is on to make his investment worthwhile.He laid off half the firm's employees; and for those who remain an ""extreme"" work ethic is promised.According to US media reports on Tuesday, Mr Musk told staff they needed to commit to a ""hardcore"" culture of ""long hours at high intensity"" or leave. Industry watcher Scott Kessler also says there is less tolerance for big spending on high-tech gambles like virtual reality or driverless cars that may not pay off in the short term.Investors also see the high wages and cushy perks some enjoy in the industry as unsustainable.""Some companies have had to face harsh realities,"" he said.Mike Morini, from WorkForce Software, which provides digital management tools said it appeared to be a turning point.""The tech industry is exiting a period of growth at all costs,"" he said.But while the big tech firms may be buffeted by economic headwinds, they are not broken.Amazon's proposed 10,000 job cuts in corporate and technology roles - its biggest such reduction to date - represents only 3% of its office staff.And the lay-offs may also be the start of new businesses as talented staff, dumped by the big firms, join or create start-ups.As veteran Silicon Valley watcher Mike Malone recently told the BBC: ""I won't write the Valley off yet. I still have a lot of hope.""",Thousands of redundancies have been announced by some of the largest firms in the industry.,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63635821,/news/business
4,UK food delivery firm Deliveroo quits Australia,"UK-based food delivery app Deliveroo says it is quitting Australia, citing tough economic conditions.The company's Australian operation, which launched in 2015, is being placed into voluntary administration.Deliveroo has come under increasing pressure to treat its 15,000 riders as employees, with the country's new government pledging to improve gig workers' conditions. It has also faced competition from rivals such as Uber Eats and Menulog.Deliveroo said it had stopped accepting orders through its app, with customers receiving an error message if they tried to place an order.""This was a difficult decision and not one we have taken lightly. We want to thank all our employees, consumers, riders and restaurant and grocery partners who have been involved with the Australian operations over the past seven years,"" Deliveroo's chief operating officer Eric French said in a statement to investors.""Our focus is now on making sure our employees, riders and partners are supported throughout this process,"" he added.In the statement the company pledged ""guaranteed enhanced severance payments for employees as well as compensation for riders and for certain restaurant partners.""Food delivery apps saw demand surge during the pandemic but have since faced challenges including customers reining in their spending and the tightening of regulations in several countries.During Australia's election campaign this year Anthony Albanese, who is now the country's prime minister, said he would work to improve the rights of workers if his party came to power.Members of his government have called gig work a ""cancer"" on the economy with accusations that it drives down the wages of a million workers. Last month, Deliveroo also announced that it planned to quit the Netherlands market at the end of November.Deliveroo's London-listed shares have lost around half of their value since the start of this year.",The firm struggled to compete with rivals as well as facing pressure to improve workers' conditions.,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63645765,/news/business
5,Energy bills push UK inflation to 41-year high,"Food prices are rising at their fastest rate for 45 years, with the cost of basics such as milk, cheese and eggs surging.Food price inflation hit 16.2% in the year to October, up from 14.5% in September, latest figures show.Energy and fuel costs also rose sharply, pushing the overall inflation rate to its highest level since 1981.The surging cost of living is squeezing household budgets, leaving many people facing hardship. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it was hitting poorer households hardest, as they spent around half of their income on food and energy, compared to about a third for those on middle incomes.October's overall inflation rate, of 11.1%, is the highest for 41 years and up from 10.1% in September.The latest figures come ahead of Thursday's Autumn Statement, in which Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce billions of pounds worth of public spending cuts and tax rises.Mr Hunt said his plans would aim to bring spiralling price rises under control, adding that he would take ""tough but necessary decisions"" to get the economy back on track.But Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the surging inflation rate would ""strike more fear in the heart of families across Britain"" and blamed ""12 years of Tory economic failure"".Inflation is a measure of the cost of living and to calculate it, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) keeps track of the prices of hundreds of everyday items, known as a ""basket of goods"".The ONS said that food prices had risen sharply in October with milk, pasta, margarine, eggs and cereals all going up.I've been conducting a very unscientific experiment by buying the same 10 basic items in Aldi almost every month since May, and yesterday's bill was another increase.My shopping list of exactly the same bread, pizza, chips, loo roll, eggs, potatoes, sugar, oats, cornflakes, and nappies has gone up from Â£14.20 in May to Â£16.29 yesterday. That's a 14.7% rise in just six months.It gives a real sense of what we're all facing at the tills, wherever you shop, and also gives a little glimpse into what the November figures will show us when they are published next month. If anyone was hoping for a reduction in food inflation then it doesn't seem like it's happening just yet.However, gas and electricity prices were still the main drivers of inflation after bills climbed again last month.The government's Energy Price Guarantee scheme did mitigate those rises, limiting the average household bill to around Â£2,500 a year. But the ONS said gas and electricity prices were still up by nearly 130% and 66% respectively compared with a year ago.Without the government's support, however, it said overall inflation would have risen to as high as 13.8%. Greg Pilley is the founder of the Stroud Brewery & Taproom in Gloucestershire, which supplies beer to pubs and shops. He told the BBC his business has been hit by a 10% rise in costs. ""Electricity has doubled over the last year,"" he said. ""We're paying Â£70,000 a year compared to Â£30,000 in the previous year, but also raw materials are going up by between 10-15%.""He said he'd had to put his prices up, while he was also paying much more in wages.""The future is fairly unpredictable,"" Mr Pilley said. ""We've got to sell three times as much beer... just to stay in the same place."" Energy and food prices have been rising since last year because of the war in Ukraine and the impact of the Covid pandemic. Rising prices have led to workers across a number of sectors calling for pay increases in line with the higher cost of living, with some industries such as the railways, staging strikes.How are you being affected by the rising cost of living? Do you have any questions you'd like our experts to answer? Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.However, some economists suggest October's 11.1% inflation rate could be the peak.Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said prices could begin to slow down ""if the government continues to freeze [energy] prices in some way"".""There is growing evidence that the upward pressure on core inflation from global factors is now fading,"" he added.Dame Deanne Julius, former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee which sets interest rates, also said some of the elements driving inflation - aside from energy bills and food prices - were stabilising.If inflation falls, it won't mean prices will come down, it means prices will rise at a slower rate.The Bank of England has put up interest rates to 3% in a bid to cool inflation. It hopes that by making borrowing money more expensive, people will spend less, demand will decrease and the pace of price rises will be curbed.But higher rates are driving up the cost of mortgages and other loans. The squeeze on spending is dragging on the UK economy which is likely to enter a recession at the end of the year.Latest figures showed the economy contracted by 0.2% between July and September and the Bank of England has warned the UK is facing a tough two-year downturn.A recession is defined as when an economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row. It's a sign an economy is performing badly, with companies often making less money and unemployment rising. Countries around the world are experiencing higher inflation. The rate in Germany is higher than in the UK, at 11.6%, while prices rose by 7.7% in the year to October in the US.However, the UK is performing worse economically than other major nations, with its economy smaller than it was before the Covid pandemic.Additional reporting by Ramzan Karmali.","High prices are hitting poorer people hardest, as they spend more of their income on food and energy.",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63641414,/news/business
6,UK orders Chinese firm to sell Welsh tech plant,"The takeover of Britain's largest microchip plant by a Chinese-owned company must be reversed, the UK government has said.Newport Wafer Fab was acquired by Dutch-based technology company Nexperia, a subsidiary of Shanghai listed Wingtech, in July 2021.However, Nexperia must now sell 86% of its stake ""to mitigate the risk national security"" following a review.The firm said it was ""shocked"" and would appeal against the decision.Semiconductors, also known as microchips or chips, allow electricity to flow through devices and are the fundamental components of everything from smart phones to the vast data centres powering the internet and are found in millions of products.The Wafer Fab deal came under scrutiny amid an ongoing global shortage of computer chips which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and severely hit a wide range of industries.Concerns were raised that the home-grown technology, considered to be of strategic importance, would become more accessible to China under Nexperia.In its decision, the UK government said the takeover of Newport Wafer Fab created two risks to national security.The first related to Nexperia's development of the Newport site, which the government said could ""undermine UK capabilities"" in producing compound semiconductors.The second, the plant's location as part of a semiconductor cluster on the Duffryn industrial estate, could ""facilitate access to technological expertise and know-how"".

7,Faisal Islam: When will price rises start to slow down?,"Britain may well have seen the peak in the actual inflation number. We are nowhere near the peak of the impact on society and households.Even in the leafy Gloucestershire Cotswolds, where there always have been pockets of deprivation, I was repeatedly told that people were simply not putting their heating on, with impacts on their health.That might have been manageable up until now, thanks to the unusually mild winter, which has also helped calm the international market prices for gas and electricity. But there is much fear about what happens when winter hits in earnest.October was always going to be a very tough month for figures on the cost of living. Despite the Energy Price Guarantee, inflation at 11.1% is at a 41-year high. Without the guarantee, which limits the rise of typical bills to Â£2,500, it could have been more like 13%.But consumers don't need to be told how wide-ranging this is, with food price inflation up again to the highest rate in 45 years, driven by the cost of things like milk and cheese.In Gloucester Market, the packs of 12 Christmas cards that normally cost Â£1, which were recently pushed up to Â£1.50, are now selling at Â£1.99.And yet in global markets there are the smallest signs that the initial reasons behind the spike in inflation a year ago, post-pandemic supply chain problems, are starting to turn. It can be seen most clearly in the used car market, which was among the very first harbingers of the broken supply chain inflation spike, and is now leading the falls. The more relaxed approach to China's ""zero Covid"" lockdowns has also meant there is some light at the end of the tunnel about prices.Energy remains tough, but much will depend on tomorrow's announcements from the chancellor at his Autumn Statement. I expect that we will hear not just about a more targeted scheme of support, but also about the rollover of some of the welfare-related support schemes that were due to end in April under Liz Truss' plans.But undoubtedly some above-average households, that do not consider themselves to be ""rich"", will be facing less protection from the cold winds of the international energy markets and the war in Ukraine.So prices will stay very high for a few months at least, as it takes some time for these global factors to feed into everyday prices.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63648502,/news/business
8,"Retailer Joules collapses risking 1,600 jobs","Clothing group Joules has collapsed into administration, putting 1,600 jobs at risk.The Leicestershire-based company, which has 132 shops, took the step after failing to secure emergency investment.The firm will be run as a going concern over Christmas while the administrators look for a buyer.Many retailers have been struggling as consumers cut spending amid rising prices. Inflation rose to 11.1% in October, latest figures show.Will Wright, one of the administrators from Interpath Advisory, said: ""Over the coming weeks, we will endeavour to continue to operate all stores as a going concern during this vitally important Christmas trading period while we assess options for the group, including a possible sale.""Mr Wright added that there had been ""an overwhelming amount of interest from interested parties"" in Joules.""At this stage we are optimistic that we will be able to secure a future for this great British brand,"" he said.Joules said last week that recent sales had been weaker than expected.It said this was largely due to ""the challenging UK economic environment which has negatively impacted consumer confidence and disposable income"".Last week, furniture retailer Made.com fell into administration, leading to hundreds of job losses, with High Street giant Next buying Made's brand name, website and intellectual property.Next had been in talks with Joules during the summer over taking a stake in the company, but these discussions ended in September. Joules was founded by Tom Joule, and started out selling clothes at country shows in 1989.Mr Joule said he had started the firm with ""one man, one tent and a lot of enthusiasm"", finding a niche in the market when he realised there was a demand for colourful clothing amid the standard tweeds worn to such events.On Monday, Mr Joule said the business ""has become too complex and our model today is not aligned to succeed in the current, tough trading environment"".As well as the Joules stores and online business, the Joules Group also runs the online-only Garden Trading Company.The squeeze on consumer spending, with households facing prices rising at the fastest pace for 40 years, has led to problems across the retail sector.Last week, Marks and Spencer warned of a ""gathering storm"" of higher costs for retailers and pressure on household budgets, adding that ""all parts"" of retail would be affected.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63651838,/news/business
9,Amazon staff laid off as tech giants cut costs,"Technology giant Amazon has started laying off staff, according to LinkedIn posts by workers who say they have been impacted by job cuts.This week it was reported that the company is planning to cut 10,000 jobs, or around 3% of its office staff.Amazon did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.It comes as thousands of jobs are being shed across the technology industry as firms see sales slow amid growing concerns about an economic downturn.Posts seen by the BBC include those from employees in Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant business, Luna cloud gaming platform division and Lab126 - the operation behind the Kindle e-reader.One employee, who said that she worked as a software development engineer in the US, posted that she was looking for a new job: ""Due to the nature of my visa, I have a limited time to lookout for new work opportunities.""Another Amazon worker who said they had been impacted by the layoffs said: ""Of course I am saddened, yet optimistic about the future because I know this means good change for me and others on my team.""The company had already introduced a hiring freeze and halted some of its warehouse expansions, warning it had over-hired during the pandemic. It had also taken steps to shut some parts of its business, cancelling projects such as a personal delivery robot.Last month Amazon's founder and chairman Jeff Bezos warned that the US economy was sending a signal to ""batten down the hatches"".Amazon's share price has fallen by more than 40% this year as it grapples with a slowdown in online sales. Other major technology companies have already announced major layoffs as they cut costs.Last week Meta - which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp - announced that it would cut 13% of its workforce.The first mass lay-offs in the firm's history will result in 11,000 employees losing their jobs.Shortly after Elon Musk took over Twitter it was confirmed that he would cut the social media platform's headcount by around 50%.In recent weeks technology giant Microsoft, payment processing platform Stripe and cloud-based business software firm Salesforce have also announced layoffs.One Seattle-based technology industry insider, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC that the job market had changed significantly in recent weeks.""The last two years has been great for job opportunities because of remote work meaning you don't have to isolate a job search to your local area. So that's seen the scramble for talent be very competitive and wages have gone up really high.""""What we're seeing now is a contraction in budgets and staffing.""He said some technology firms companies, including Amazon, are likely to be hit particularly hard.""Amazon is very, very bloated. So there's lots of people there but they're not providing a lot of value so they're first on the chopping block.""",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63631877,/news/business
10,Estee Lauder to buy designer brand Tom Ford,"Luxury cosmetics firm Estee Lauder will buy designer fashion house Tom Ford in a deal worth $2.8bn (Â£2.4bn), the company has announced.The deal would be Estee Lauder's biggest acquisition to date.The US beauty firm already licenses Tom Ford fragrances and cosmetics, and beat off competition from Gucci owner Kering SA to clinch the deal.Estee Lauder said the acquisition would ""unlock new opportunities"". Ford said it was the ideal home for the brand.Tom Ford said in a joint statement with Estee Lauder: ""I could not be happier with this acquisition"".He said the Estee Lauder companies had been ""an extraordinary partner from the first day of my creation of the company and I am thrilled to see them become the luxury stewards in this next chapter of the Tom Ford brand.""Tom Ford himself will remain in his current position as creative director until 2023 at least, the companies announced.However, one financial expert told the BBC that he was eyeing the takeover with caution.""The question becomes whether the Tom Ford name is worth $2.8bn when he steps away and rides off into the sunset as a billionaire in 2023,"" Tom Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital said.He added: ""Will Estee Lauder be able to sell his wares in his absence or be left holding the bag?""The deal comes at a time when the luxury goods market is set for global growth, according to analysts, and China is slowly lifting coronavirus restrictions, allowing the sector's high-demand consumers to slowly return to pre-pandemic shopping habits.Chinese consumers accounted for 35% of global demand for luxury goods before the pandemic, according to Bloomberg data.Global analysts at Bain & Company said: ""The global luxury market is projected to grow by 21% in 2022, reaching â¬1.4 trillion (Â£1.2 trillion)â¦ even given a downturn in global economic conditions. ""And it remains poised to see further expansion next year [2023], and for the rest of the decade to 2030"".It added that the personal luxury goods market worldwide, specific to clothes, bags and cosmetics, is expected to be worth â¬353bn by the end of 2022 - projected growth of 22% - compared with the previous year.Tom Ford, who first launched his brand in 2005, is the current head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America and previously worked as creative director at Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent in the 1990s and early 2000s.Following the news, shares in Estee Lauder, worth billions, fell slightly in after-hours trading.

11,India tech workers fight back amid mass layoffs,"Thousands of young Indians are suddenly staring at an uncertain future as technology companies and start-ups announce mass layoffs due to global headwinds and funding crunches. But many are refusing to stay quiet about it.In October, when Ravi (name changed on request) realised that he and several colleagues were likely to lose their jobs with a major Indian edtech firm, he immediately set up a  private messaging group with them.The group soon became a ""safe space"" for Ravi and his teammates to air their fears, share tips on dealing with the management and discuss labour laws and workers' rights. ""It helped many in the team negotiate better exit policies with the company,"" Ravi says.The past few months have been difficult for Indian workers in private companies - especially in the tech sector. Edtech firms Byju's and Unacademy have cut hundreds of jobs; social media giant Twitter has laid off more than half of its staff in India and Indians are among those affected after Meta - Facebook's parent company - shaved off about 13% of its 87,000-strong workforce.The spate of layoffs has sparked outrage on social media and many of those affected are turning to the internet -  like their counterparts in other countries - to air their dissatisfaction and form support networks. They're tweeting about unceremonious firings, asking for jobs on LinkedIn, and using messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Slack to rally colleagues, assert their rights and share information with journalists.This is partly because the culture of shame and silence that once existed around redundancies in India is gradually wearing thin as mass layoffs become more common. Pritha Dutt, a management and development sector professional, says that even a couple of decades ago, terminations were most likely chalked up to ""a performance issue"".""Today, layoffs and downsizing have become accepted business practices, so terminations are no longer a taboo topic,"" she says.And while the jury is still out on how effective social media is as a tool for redressal, experts say that it is helping unite and amplify voices, especially as trade unions are no longer as powerful as they used to be. While millions of Indian workers still belong to trade unions, the movement as a whole has been weakening for years. A number of factors - including burgeoning private sector jobs, new labour reforms and a rise in contractual work - have played a role in denting their membership and might.""Along with employers making themselves more accessible, social media too is giving employees a platform to air their grievances, thereby reducing the need for a mediator - a role traditionally played by unions,"" says Professor Chandrasekhar Sripada at the Indian School of Business.After Byju's announced in October that it would ""rationalise"" about 2,500 employees to ""achieve profitability"", many of its employees have been speaking to the media - often anonymously - about the company culture and the pressures they face. Sacked Twitter employees have taken to social media to vent their frustrations. ""Always a Tweep never a Twit,"" tweeted one former employee in a veiled reference to new owner Elon Musk's Twitter bio at the time. ""Got fired without even a confirmation email. There's always a new low,"" said another.With the job market expanding, Ms Dutt says employees have become more confident about the marketability of their skills and don't mind standing up for their rights, even if that means burning bridges by calling out a person or organisation on social media.And this public outrage can sometimes help, like pushing employers to apologise for firing staff in an insensitive manner or for promoting a toxic work culture. But Ms Dutt cautions that this success could be limited and short-lived. The option may also not be available to everyone - many still fear speaking out as they worry it might jeopardise future job prospects, or invoke legal action from their employer.That's why many employees are also looking for other ways to air their grievances and fight for their rights. In the southern city of Thiruvananthapuram, 140 Byju's employees who alleged they were being forced to resign went on a protest and also met a Kerala state minister, who announced an investigation into the matter - the state is governed by a coalition of Left parties, which advocates for workers' rights.Days later, Byju's said it had reversed its decision to shut down operations at Thiruvananthapuram.Three former employees at an edtech firm told the BBC on condition of anonymity that they were working with a trade union to negotiate severance and notice periods with the company. Suman Dasmahapatra, president of the Bangalore chapter of the All India IT & ITeS Employees' Union - a registered trade union that has been assisting hundreds of tech employees with labour disputes since 2018 - said that the organisation's membership has been steadily growing. He concedes that this is still tiny compared with the total number of employees - a majority of IT sector professionals, he says, are still uncomfortable being part of trade unions, either because they fear reprisal from the management, or because ""they don't see themselves as 'workers'"".But Mr Dasmahapatra says he is confident that India will see a resurgence in unionisation as the push and pull of global economic forces make the job market more volatile.Over the past couple of years, US giants such as Amazon, Starbucks and Apple have seen their workers form unions and observers say calls for unionisation are likely to grow louder, and spread across industries. Prof Sripada, however, disagrees. He says that the proliferation and strengthening of trade unions need not become the norm, as workplaces have already become more conscious about adopting progressive, people-centric policies. ""Unions are a product of bad people management. When employers fail, unions rise. Employers today have the benefit of hindsight so the responsibility lies with them to make people management the centre of business,"" he says.""But if organisations continue laying off people in an insensitive and callous manner - as we're seeing happen frequently - the story might be different.""",,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-63619920,/news/business
12,What to do with 18 shipping containers of rotting cabbages,"Not many people would know what to do with 18 containers filled with rotting cabbages.But Jake Slinn does.The 23-year-old founder of JS Global operates in the cargo salvage industry - a small but essential cog in the machinery of global trade.Last year one of the larger cogs in that machine got stuck in the Suez Canal. The world's biggest container ship, the Ever Given, blocked the key shipping lane for six days in March.Part of that ship's cargo was the 18 containers, each weighing 20 tonnes, of cabbages that ended up with Mr Slinn. His Ipswich-based firm organised their delivery to an anaerobic digestion plant, where they were turned into fuel.Cargo may need to be salvaged for a wide variety of reasons. Like the Ever Given cabbages, some goods may perish during their journey and need to be destroyed. Local authorities may deem goods unsafe and order their destruction - a particular problem when Covid-19 hit.""During the pandemic we destroyed tens of thousands of items of fake PPE, mainly fake masks and fake gloves, that had been imported from China,"" says Mr Slinn, whose parents are in the waste management business.It's not only damaged or unsafe cargo that needs to be salvaged.If a business goes bust, its cargo may be stranded at a port somewhere. If goods are delayed, they miss a key deadline, like Christmas, and may be abandoned.Cargo can even be unwanted because the cost of storing the items at the port or in a nearby warehouse exceeds its value to its owner.In such cases, a salvage company will often step in and find new buyers.Paul and Poppy Vidler of UK-based Crown Salvage have decades of experience of finding buyers for unwanted goods.The company recently acquired containers of easy-to-assemble housing units and have been working on finding buyers.""We sourced them from Turkey and have been having conversations with lots of people, from places like La Palma after the volcano [eruption in 2021] as well as Ghana.""They can be set up quickly wherever there's a housing problem,"" says Mr Vidler.More technology of business:With a big database of buyers around the world, they can take on large quantities of industrial goods, including chemicals and plastics.""We're larger and global, it's not like that reality TV programme,"" Mrs Vidler explains, referring to US hit show Storage Wars, where contestants bid on storage units with the goal of profiting from the abandoned goods inside them.The salvage companies say their work is good for the environment.""We don't send anything to the landfill, not just because it's not good for the environment, but it's also not cost-effective,"" Mr Slinn says.Mrs Vidler agrees. ""We're not greenwashing. What we do actually helps avoid these things ending up in landfill.""Aside from these environmental benefits, a more immediate benefit is that salvaging these goods helps release the handbrake on global trade, emptying containers that can then go back into circulation.""We'll empty a container in the morning and it's already going back out on a ship empty by the afternoon,"" Mr Slinn says.Getting containers back into circulation was a particularly pressing issue in the immediate aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.In September 2021 the price of a 40ft (12m) container hit a high of almost $10,400 (Â£9,160), according to the World Container Index produced by analysts Drewry.Since then the price has fallen back to around $2,773, well below the five-year average of around $3,759 according to the Index.For those in the cargo salvage industry, delays, financial turmoil and strikes can all provide opportunities.Recent industrial action in Felixstowe, the UK's largest container port resulted in an increase in abandoned cargo. Mr Slinn disposed of a container of pork, which was due to be exported from the UK, but perished because the ship picking it up couldn't dock at the port.""A lot of people were abandoning their stock because of the shutdown. It was a frustrating period for a lot of people but a good thing for us,"" Mr Slinn says.Anything that makes life difficult for companies, like soaring energy prices, raises the likelihood that containers will be stranded.Companies may be unable to afford the increased cost of storing goods in warehouses, while others may go out of business altogether, leaving their goods unwanted and stuck.A tough economic environment provides opportunities for the salvage industry, but also comes with risk.""There are also disasters we can be affected by,"" Mrs Vidler says.Firms like hers rely on being able to connect buyers and sellers and being able to get goods to their destinations.Whilst there is always uncertainty, the business is never dull, according to Mr Slinn.""Every day is different, you never know what you're going to be dealing with.""",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62979352,/news/business
13,'Digital newsletters really humanise you to your readers',"Author Elle Griffin says she would definitely turn down a book deal if she was ever offered one.""I'd never accept oneâ¦ traditional book publishing is full of bad math, and even worse marketing,"" says the 37-year-old writer of gothic novels.Last year, instead of releasing her first book, called Obscurity, as physical copies in High Street bookstores, or as a Kindle version to download, she started to self-publish chapters as email instalments.Using online publishing platform Substack, the new chapters were emailed out every week or two to Ms Griffin's subscribers. She already had more than 3,000 non-paying followers before she started to release the book, as she had for a number of years been writing articles on numerous topics.But by the end of the first 12 months of her novel's serialisation her subscriber numbers had more than doubled, thanks to recommendations from readers and other Substack account holders.Based in Salt Lake City, Utah, Ms Griffin now has 6,843 subscribers, and, crucially, 301 paying ones.They are charged from $10 (Â£8.60) a month, or $50 per annum, and Ms Griffin says in the first year she earned nearly $18,000.With many of us spending more time online than ever before, writing coach Nancy Erickson says it makes sense for novelists like Ms Griffin to focus on offering readers direct digital access to their work.""What you really want to do is meet your audience wherever they're already engaged,"" says Ms Erickson, who is based in St Louis, Missouri. She adds that digital engagement ""helps authors build their brands, as well as finding other revenue generating activities"".Jane Ostler is executive vice president of global thought leadership at brand consulting company Kantar. She sees online serialisation as an effective form of digital marketing, a way for new writers to get themselves better known. ""I think there is a lot of potential here for a new writer,"" she says.While prolific Nottingham-based author Kristina Adams hasn't serialised any of her 16 self-published novels and three non-fiction titles, she has been sending free weekly digital newsletters about literature and life to subscribers since 2014. This was two years before the now 32-year-old released her first book.She continues to send these emails out to more than 2,500 people via a service called MailerLite. They include stories about things referenced in her books, talks about her dog Millie, and promotion of upcoming releases.""Digital newsletters in particular, I think more than social media, really humanise you to your readers,"" says Ms Adams, who writes romance titles under her full name, and ghost stories as KC Adams. ""It gives you a much closer connection.""And sending out the newsletters really makes a different to sales. Every time I sent one out I get an up-turn in sales.""You can think that you are sending out far too many, but in most cases only about a fifth of people will open each email. So while you think you are shouting and demanding attention, most subscribers wouldn't see it that way.""Back in Salt Lake City, Ms Griffin is now serialising her second novel. She says she was inspired to release her book in instalments by 19th Century French writer Alexandre Dumas.Like her, he wrote gothic fiction, and his well-known novel The Count of Monte Cristo was serialised in a Parisian weekly newspaper in the 1840s.New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.As is the norm for Substack, people can read the chapters of Ms Griffin's novels for free via her page on the app and website.However, paying subscribers get extra benefits, such as the ability to read Ms Griffin's commentaries, post their own thoughts, chat with other subscribers, and even write and publish their own essays.Ms Griffin says all this feedback is very helpful.""Recently, two readers mentioned that they wished my chapters were longer, so I started making them longer,"" she says. ""I love being able to respond in real-time.""Ms Griffin adds that she had researched self-publishing her books in digital form via Amazon, but that her subscription model is far more lucrative.She explains the maths. ""Say I sold 1,000 books on Amazon, then I'd make $1,000, maybe more, maybe $5,000.""But if I - instead of just selling it - adopted a subscription model, and charged readers $8 or $9 a month, then from the same 1,000 fans, I could presumably make $100,000 in salary.""She adds that with a traditional book deal she'd be even worse off financially, as she'd likely only get a royalty rate of around 15% of revenues.In addition to the subscription payments, Ms Griffin's followers can pay to buy and download the digital artwork that she designs for each chapter.""I think the beauty of it [serialisation] is you can start grassroots, and start from the bottom,"" she says. ""I'm not Stephen King, I'm just barely getting started.""Additional reporting by Will Smale",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63565577,/news/business
14,Why smart thermostats don't always save you money,"A few years ago, Dominic McCann realised that his smart thermostat was a treasure trove of data. So he decided to hack it, in order to track what his boiler was doing literally every minute of the day.Using open source software, he accessed data from the thermostat online and plotted graphs that charted boiler activity against the changing temperature of a particular room. And when he upgraded the bi-folding door in his dining room to a triple-glazed model, the system instantly captured the difference that made.""I could quickly get a handle on, 'Oh, if I do this, I've saved this amount of energy,'"" he recalls. Insights like this helped him to save money, over time.Mr McCann, who lives in Manchester, was aided by his technical background. He is director of Azymuth Acoustics UK, a noise assessment firm. When he first tinkered with his thermostat, back in 2019, he was arguably in a small minority. But with rocketing energy prices, and the associated cost-of-living crisis, more people are turning to their smart thermostats seeking answers to the question: how do I reduce my energy bill?Generally speaking, a smart thermostat is a connected version of a traditional central heating controller - one you can program and adjust via a smartphone or tablet app, or smart speaker. Manufacturers have long touted these gadgets as money savers. Over the years, they have certainly provided increasingly detailed information about users' energy consumption and offered partially automated heating control. And yet there is still debate over how beneficial smart thermostats are, with some research indicating that installing one doesn't always result in reduced energy use.Google Nest, Honeywell, Drayton Wiser, Tado, Hive - all these brands say their systems make it easier to manage your heating. And many offer to learn how you heat your home, or detect when you're out, and respond automatically in an effort to curtail usage and save you money.Mr McCann was arguably ahead of his time. In response to the cost-of-living crisis, smart thermostat maker Tado recently launched a software update that provides monthly bill predictions to help users keep within a budget. There are also room-by-room comparisons so people can see which rooms in their home require the most heating.A spokesman for Tado says that the ""vast majority"" of its users are able to save money with its system.There are more than 75 million smart thermostats installed worldwide and this number is expected to more than double by 2025, according to Neil Barbour, an industry analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence. He cites research from The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, which estimated that smart thermostats enable a roughly 10% reduction in home heating and cooling per household. With that in mind, Mr Barbour and his colleagues have calculated that the US could reduce its total energy consumption by 45.4 terawatt hours - roughly the same amount of energy used by the entire state of Mississippi in 2020 - if every home with a heating, ventilation and cooling system installed a smart thermostat by 2026.That would be quite a saving. But the research on how people actually use these devices paints a mixed picture. One study of Honeywell smart thermostat data from 1,379 households in California, published in September, found that users generally undid the benefits of the gadgets by manually overriding their scheduled programme of heating or cooling. In other words, it was easy to boost the heating, for example, which meant some people eroded their energy savings.However, a separate analysis published in 2020 of data from 20,000 Ecobee smart thermostats in the US found that users sometimes overrode their device's schedule in a way that used less energy. So manual interventions, overall, were not as costly as expected. The study was part-funded by Ecobee.Smart thermostats may struggle when users expect them to do all the work for them, suggests the lead author of the second study, Brent Huchuk, who now works for tech firm PassiveLogic.According to him, someone who is good at tweaking their own system is likely to do better than a smart thermostat.""It's pretty hard to beat someone who's actively managing [their] heating and cooling schedule,"" he says.He also notes that the automatic interventions of smart thermostats will be limited when people work from home, since that reduces the number of opportunities the smart device has to shut the heating off. There are also technical quirks to be aware of. In the UK, for instance, some highly energy efficient boilers on the market can modulate (adjust up or down) how much energy they use, in response to the amount of heating required.But to take full advantage of this, you have to choose a smart thermostat that is fully compatible with your specific model of boiler. The Heating Hub, an independent consumer advice organisation, has published details about this online.""It's such a minefield for households,"" says founder Jo Alsop.In the future, smart thermostats could theoretically track energy prices in real-time and allow people to heat their homes when it is cheapest to do so, suggests Dr Huchuk. A 2017 study by Enrico Costanza at University College, London, and colleagues, experimented with exactly this idea. Participants received specially designed thermostats that displayed sample pricing data moment-by-moment.That might be a little too much information for many. But the study suggested that, across multiple households, this could prompt a reduction in overall energy consumption. Prof Costanza argues that, in reality, it would be more useful to give people information about their energy use over a longer period, say a month, or a forecast that explains how much someone could save by heating the house a little less in the morning, for example. ""Making it easier for people to understand how they spend energy can make a difference,"" says Prof Costanza.More technology of business:",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63511163,/news/business
15,The shops that connect people with their home countries,"At family-owned food shop Popat Mithai & Farsan, owner Vijaya Popat and her all-female team are often so busy dealing with customers in multiple languages that there's barely time to sit down, let alone chat with a nosy journalist.Mrs Popat set up the business in Leicester back in 2011 to sell Indian sweets and savouries, and it has grown from two members of staff to 15 today. And an online operation was launched in 2018.Serving the South Asian diaspora in the East Midlands city and further afield, sales soared during the coronavirus pandemic, as customers sought more comfort food - the tastes that they or their forebears brought to the UK from countries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.Mrs Popat's son Shyam was put forward to speak to the BBC. ""My mum is widely known in the community as being the person that runs the business,"" he says.""And they all want to speak to her specifically to see if she can source particular things.""He adds that it's not just first generation immigrants, or those who have just moved to the UK recently, that make up the core customer base. Instead it is also the second generation, who might be buying food for their families, and increasingly online.""During the lockdowns the website was a total lifesaver, and now we're out of lockdown it has become a thriving arm of the business in itself,"" says Shyam Popat. ""Online sales now account for approximately one-quarter to one-third of the entire turnover of the business.""In addition to importing products from South Asia, the shop also buys from Kenya.The boost that the world's diasporas give to trade between countries is difficult to quantify, but governments are increasingly aware of the economic importance of migrant populations and their descendants.Kenya announced in September that it would be creating a new ministry for Kenyans living abroad, and US President Joe Biden has announced that he will tell next month's US-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington that he wishes to ""amplify diaspora ties"".But just how big are the world's diasporas? There are currently 281 million people who live in a country other than the one in which they were born, according to the 2022 World Migration Report from the United Nation's International Organization for Migration (IOM).That number equates to 3.6% of the global population, or one in 30 people. And it doesn't include any children those people have that are born in their new country, nor does it include the descendants of former migrants.For this reason, the IOM defines the terms ""migrants"" and ""diasporas"" (which comes from the Greek to scatter) separately. The later also including descendants of former migrants ""whose identity and sense of belonging, either real or symbolic, have been shaped by their migration experience and background"". This equates to billions of people, but an exact number is very difficult to quantify given that it is determined by a person's cultural identity. Even the IOM said back in 2020 that ""currently there are no attempts to measure global diaspora populations per se"".More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade.What is certain, is that the entrepreneurial drive within migrant populations has long been recognised. A 2010 report by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said that immigrant entrepreneurs were better educated than their native counterparts, and more likely to create a new business.And often those firms are involved in the importation of food, clothing or other goods from a migrant's former country, such as Indian-born Vijaya Popat and her thriving shop in Leicester. The store, and others like it, played their part in India's exports to the UK totalling $10.4bn last year.Based in Paris, Olivier Habiyambere is helping to boost Kenyan exports to Europe. He is the founder of website Kenyan Diaspora Market, which imports food and clothing in bulk from the African country, and then sells it to customer across the European continent.Mr Habiyambere, who was raised in Kenya, came up with the idea for the business when he moved to Paris to study and met others from Kenya and East Africa.""Everybody wanted Kenyan products, but the issue was bringing the products from Kenya to here,"" he says. ""People could pick up the products when they went to Kenya, but it's not like they could do that every year.""So he launched the business in April 2022 to offer Kenyans in Europe an easier way of buying products from home. Mr Habiyambere adds that business has grown steadily, helped by Kenyan communities spreading the word via WhatsApp groups.While Kenyan Diaspora Market is focused on Kenyan migrants, Glasgow-based website Agora Greek Delicacies now has more non-Greek customers than those from within the UK's Greek communities. It was set up a decade ago by husband and wife Christina Lyropoulou and Michael Sofianos, who had gone to university in the UK. They now employ 14 people and supply imported Greek food and drink to restaurants, cafes, individuals, and other businesses.""We started expanding to the British audience - so those travelling to Greece or had Greek friends,"" says Ms Lyropoulou. ""And our online shop saw an increase in sales of about 1000% in the first months of the lockdown.""Prof Pragya Agarwal, a behavioural and data scientist at the University of Loughborough, regularly buys products originating from her native India for herself and her family in the UK.""For me personally, it's about maintaining the connection with the motherland, the fatherland - whatever you call it,"" she says.She laughs as she describes her love of Indian mangos, and admits she regularly would regularly order from a particular store online in a bid to get her mango fix, especially during the pandemic.""It's what I used to eat growing up in India every summer - every day after every meal.""Maria Elo, is an associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark who has a number of books and articles on diaspora and trade.She says it's important to be aware of the framing that occurs whenever diaspora is discussed, with migrants often described in one of two ways. One narrative is that migration and diaspora are problematic. Prof Elo describes that as a ""deficit view"" with negative connotations. But she adds there is also a positive narrative, which involves ""a big promise for business and economy"".She adds that research shows that diaspora entrepreneurs are agile, and encourage cross-over products. ""We all eat pizza today, although we're not all Italians and that is something that crossed over a long time ago.""",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63542786,/news/business
16,What is behind the big tech companies' job cuts?,"The first sign of job cuts at Amazon came from LinkedIn posts from laid-off employees.Then, Amazon's devices boss, Dave Limp, announced: ""It pains me... We will lose talented Amazonians from the devices & services org"".Across the tech industry, at firms like Twitter, Meta, Coinbase and Snap, workers have announced they are ""seeking new opportunities"".Worldwide, more than 120,000 jobs have been lost, according to the Layoffs.fyi website, which tracks tech job cuts.Different firms cut employees for different reasons but there are common themes.As our lives moved online during the pandemic, the tech giants' businesses boomed, and executives believed the good times - for them - would continue to roll.Meta, for example, took on more than 15,000 people in the first nine months of this year.Now executives announcing cuts have said they miscalculated.""I made the decision to significantly increase our investments,"" chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees, as he laid off 13% of them.""Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.""Online adverts are the chief source of income for many tech firms, but for the advertising business, dark clouds have been gathering. Firms have faced growing opposition to intrusive advertising practices. For example, Apple made it harder to track people's online activity and sell that data to advertisers. And as the economy ran into trouble, many firms slashed their online advertising budgets.In the financial technology sector, rising interest rates have also hit companies.""It's been a really a disappointing quarter of earnings for many of the big tech companies,"" said technology analyst Paolo Pescatore of PP Foresight. ""No-one's immune.""Even Apple has signalled caution, with chief executive Tim Cook saying the firm was ""still hiring"", but only on a ""deliberate basis."" Amazon attributed its job cuts to an ""unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment"" forcing it to prioritize on what mattered most to customers.""As part of our annual operating planning review process, we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change,"" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. ""As we've gone through this, given the current macro-economic environment (as well as several years of rapid hiring), some teams are making adjustments, which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary. We don't take these decisions lightly, and we are working to support any employees who may be affected.""Investors have also piled on the pressure to cut costs, accusing firms of being bloated and slow to respond to signs of slowdown.In an open letter to Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, activist investor Sir Christopher Hohn urged the firm to slash jobs and pay.Alphabet had to be more disciplined about costs, he wrote, and cut losses from projects like its self-driving car company, Waymo.Elon Musk is certainly of the view that there is room to cut costs at his latest investment, Twitter, which has struggled to either turn a profit or attract new users.Added to that, many commentators argue Mr Musk paid over the odds for the firm, and the pressure is on to make his investment worthwhile.He laid off half the firm's employees; and for those who remain an ""extreme"" work ethic is promised.According to US media reports on Tuesday, Mr Musk told staff they needed to commit to a ""hardcore"" culture of ""long hours at high intensity"" or leave. Industry watcher Scott Kessler also says there is less tolerance for big spending on high-tech gambles like virtual reality or driverless cars that may not pay off in the short term.Investors also see the high wages and cushy perks some enjoy in the industry as unsustainable.""Some companies have had to face harsh realities,"" he said.Mike Morini, from WorkForce Software, which provides digital management tools said it appeared to be a turning point.""The tech industry is exiting a period of growth at all costs,"" he said.But while the big tech firms may be buffeted by economic headwinds, they are not broken.Amazon's proposed 10,000 job cuts in corporate and technology roles - its biggest such reduction to date - represents only 3% of its office staff.And the lay-offs may also be the start of new businesses as talented staff, dumped by the big firms, join or create start-ups.As veteran Silicon Valley watcher Mike Malone recently told the BBC: ""I won't write the Valley off yet. I still have a lot of hope.""",Thousands of redundancies have been announced by some of the largest firms in the industry.,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63635821,/news/technology
17,MrBeast overtakes PewDiePie as top YouTuber,"MrBeast has ended PewDiePie's reign as the YouTuber with the most subscribers - the first change at the top in almost 10 years.Swedish creator PewDiePie, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, became the most-subscribed YouTuber in August 2013 with his gaming reaction videos.In 2019, he was the first person to attract 100 million subscribers.But the philanthropy of MrBeast, really called Jimmy Donaldson, gained him his 112 millionth subscriber this month.Although YouTube does not show the exact numbers, that pushed him above PewDiePie's 111 million.MrBeast is known for videos featuring huge cash giveaways and prizes, as well as charity work.In 2021, he launched a separate philanthropy-themed YouTube channel, which itself has more than 10 million subscribers, and he has a licensed charity that functions as a food bank to feed communities across the US.He and fellow YouTuber Mark Rober organised international collaborative fundraisers TeamSeas and TeamTrees, which focus on environmental issues - the latter raising more than $24m (Â£16.7m) to plant 20 million trees worldwide.And PewDiePie himself donated almost $70,000 to the TeamTrees project.British YouTuber Steven Bridges, whose videos have millions of views on the platform, told the BBC MrBeast has ""mastered the skill"" of making compelling content.""There's probably no other YouTuber in the world who understands it as well as MrBeast,"" he said. ""Making an entertaining video is one thing, but ensuring that every single second of a video keeps the viewer hooked is very difficult to pull off, and MrBeast's retention - the percent of the video the average viewer watches - and view counts speak for themselves.""Really, MrBeast is playing the game of making the most entertaining videos that appeal to the biggest number of people, and he's consistently knocking it out of the park. ""I don't think there's any YouTuber out there that's surprised MrBeast has taken the number one spot.""Though neither has yet commented on the milestone, PewDiePie previously said he thought MrBeast would ""definitely"" overtake him.""I can't wait for it to be over,"" he joked in a video from August 2022. ""He definitely deserves it. I hope he does it.""And while MrBeast has become the most-subscribed individual user on YouTube, he is some way off having the biggest YouTube channel. T-Series, an Indian music video publishing company, leads the way in that category with more than 200 million subscribers.Despite their apparent rivalry for the top YouTuber crown, MrBeast publicly supported PewDiePie when the music video channel rose to prominence.In 2018, PewDiePie had the top YouTube channel altogether, and became embroiled in a - mostly jokey - public rivalry with T-Series over the top spot.MrBeast was the first prominent YouTuber to make videos supporting PewDiePie, buying radio adverts and billboards in North Carolina urging people to subscribe to him.Over the course of a year, PewDiePie eventually lost the top channel spot to T-Series, although he went from about 60 million to 90 million subscribers in the contest, making his lead as top YouTuber apparently unassailable.That has ultimately proved not to be the case.","PewDiePie's almost 10 years of dominance have come to an end, as MrBeast reaches 112 million subscribers.",https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63635382,/news/technology
18,Nvidia investigates reports cables melting in PCs,"Graphics card-maker Nvidia is investigating reports its latest cards may be causing power cables to melt.Social-media users posted photos online appearing to show damage to the cable used to power the Nvidia RTX 4090, launched in October 2022.They claimed the graphics card, which retails for Â£1,699, was ""melting"" the adapter supplied in the box.Nvidia told BBC News it was looking into the claims.""We continue to investigate the reports - however, we don't have further details to share yet,"" it said. It was ""committed to supporting our customers"" and would provide an expedited return service.The graphics card is the most powerful yet from Nvidia - but this comes at a cost of drawing 450W of power - about half that of a typical microwave.It allows gamers to play the latest releases at the highest fidelity yet - with 4K resolution and maxed-out settings.The graphics card proved popular at launch, with UK stock selling out on Nvidia's website within 10 minutes.The adapter has 12 pins, arranged in two rows of six. In the photos posted online, one or more of these pins appear malformed.Jonathan, based in Sweden, one of the people who shared pictures of his graphics card on social media, told BBC News he had been ""really surprised and mad"" when he discovered the issue.""I really need the graphics card for my work,"" he said. ""I cannot do any work without it.""After the damage, I made a Reddit post, out of frustration - and later, Nvidia contacted me personally. The only thing they did was ask me to [return the card].""Nvidia should make a public announcement about this issue.""Another user, Nicholas, felt ""unlucky and a little sad"" when he checked his cable.""Before I even saw the damage, I actually heard it as I was pulling the adapter out,"" he said. ""The sound of plastic breaking was pretty bad - the top six pins were melted.""Gordon Fitzsimmons, based in Glasgow, told BBC News he had thought the photos he had seen saw online were a result of user error - until he had received his card.""You think these people must be abusing the cable,"" he said. ""They must be bending it really badly, or not plugging it in fully, so I was definitely blaming it on on the user - until, obviously, I opened mine up and [have] seen that one of the pins has just started to melt.""It does make you very nervous, some of the posts I've seen, people are suffering real anxiety over this.""Alex, based in Chicago, also said Nvidia's response after he discovered the fault in two separate graphics cards had been ""unacceptable"".""The issue has not been resolved,"" he told BBC News. ""It is evident by the fact that the replacement graphics card I received is also showing signs of melting. ""There has been no official statement from Nvidia on the matter. ""Nvidia and their partners should make a recall.""Electrical Safety First product-safety engineer Giuseppe Capanna said: ""Issues surrounding melted plastic are indicative of a build-up of heat that should otherwise not be occurring to this level. ""Where plastic is melting, temperatures may be exceeding an acceptable level - and the root cause should certainly be investigated by any manufacturer with haste.""",Social-media users share photos appearing to show damage to the cable supplied with the Nvidia RTX 4090.,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63635379,/news/technology
19,"Work long hours or leave, Musk tells Twitter staff","Elon Musk has told Twitter staff that they must commit to working ""long hours at high intensity"" or else leave the company, according to reports.In an email to staff, the social media firm's new owner said workers should agree to the pledge if they wanted to stay, the Washington Post reported.Those who do not sign up by Thursday will be given three months' severance pay, Mr Musk said.The BBC has contacted Twitter for comment.In his email to staff, also seen by The Guardian, Mr Musk said that Twitter ""will need to be extremely hardcore"" in order to succeed.""This will mean working long hours at high intensity. Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade,"" he said.Workers were told that they needed to click on a link by 17:00 EST on Thursday, if they want to be ""part of the new Twitter"".He added: ""Whatever decision you make, thank you for your efforts to make Twitter successful.""The world's richest man has already announced half of Twitter's staff are being let go, after he bought the company in a $44bn (Â£38.7bn) deal.Mr Musk said he had ""no choice"" over the cuts as the company was losing $4m (Â£3.51m) a day. He has blamed ""activist groups pressuring advertisers"" for a ""massive drop in revenue"".A host of top Twitter executives have also stepped down following his purchase of the firm.Last week, the entrepreneur told Twitter staff that remote working would end and ""difficult times"" lay ahead, according to reports.In an email to staff, the owner of the social media firm said workers would be expected in the office for at least 40 hours a week, Bloomberg reported.Mr Musk added that there was ""no way to sugar coat the message"" that the slowing global economy was going to hit Twitter's advertising revenues.But tech investor Sarah Kunst said the real reason Twitter is facing difficulties is because Mr Musk's takeover has saddled the company with debt. His behaviour since the takeover has also led some advertisers to pause their spending, she said. ""He's now trying to inflict that pain and uncertainty on the employees,"" she said.She added that there was a question mark over how enforceable Mr Musk's email about hours to staff really was.""Can you just send an email to staff who already work for you, and just unilaterally change their working contract? That remains to be seen.""Mr Musk himself has been sleeping at Twitter in recent weeks, even while leading electric carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX.He described his work habits in a US court on Wednesday, where he appeared to defend the eye-popping $56bn pay package he received from electric carmaker Tesla in 2018.""I pretty much work all the time, with rare exceptions."" he said. In response to questioning, he later added that the ""fundamental organisational restructuring"" at Twitter would be complete by the end of this week.Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, warned it was further evidence that Twitter's culture had ""dramatically changed"" with Mr Musk at the helm.""Elon Musk is not going to be doing candlelight dinners and playing ping pong in Twitter's cafeteria and this is a shock to the system,"" he said.""But he also needs to play nice in the sandbox because if key Twitter engineers and developers leave, this will be a major void in the Twitter ecosystem,"" he warned. ""There's a careful balance ahead for him, in this tightrope act.""Do you work long hours either willingly or because you feel you have no choice?

20,A million owed money by failed crypto exchange,"Over a million people and businesses could be owed money following the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, according to bankruptcy filings.There have also been reports that FTX suffered a hack, taking millions of dollars of crypto from the firm.It's a worrying time for individuals who have money in the business.In the UK, crypto assets are largely unregulated, and experts and financial watchdogs warn there's little protection for consumers. Despite strong warnings from watchdogs about the risk of crypto investments, around 6.7 million people in the UK own or have bought crypto assets - close to one-tenth of the population.In September, financial watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned that FTX may be providing financial services or products in the UK without its authorisation. It said bluntly: ""You are unlikely to get your money back if things go wrong.""It now has a page dealing with the FTX liquidation. Again, the message is that options for those who've invested in it are limited.Asked about the collapse of the multi-billion dollar exchange, the Governor of the Bank of England said it did not pose risks to the wider economy.""I don'tâ¦ anywhere detect what I would call a systemic fallout from FTX,"" Andrew Bailey said, noting that its activity in the UK was ""not very substantial"".He added that global regulators were ""doing a lot of work"" to improve oversight of crypto assets. ""There is ownership of crypto-currency in this country, no doubt, I get asked about it particularly when I go to schools actually, interestingly,"" he said. ""It is not something we can be relaxed about and let me reassure you we are not relaxed about it.""There is at least a liquidation process in the case of FTX, which will divide up the remains of the firm among those to whom it owes money. And founder Sam Bankman-Fried claimed in a tweet that ""my goalâmy one goalâis to do right by customers"". In many other cases there is not even a bankruptcy process.Gavin Brown, Associate Professor in Financial Technology at the University of Liverpool, pointed to a recent report which suggested that ""42% of exchanges which failed simply disappeared without a trace"".But the bankruptcy may not provide much comfort. Prof Brown told the BBC: ""In the event of exchange failure, or even bankruptcy, it is the investors who are on the hook for losses.""He and other experts warned that often small investors will go to the back of the queue when what remains of a crypto business is divided up among creditors.Experts doubt much money will be coming back. ""The unfortunate news is that the money's all gone. It's just not there any more. Investors should expect pennies on the dollar,"" said crypto blogger and author David Gerard.Mr Gerard argued that in many of these failures there are ""real liabilities but imaginary assets"" and that a huge proportion of the assets are in exchanges' own tokens - such as FTX's FTT token -  to which ""they've assigned a spurious value in the billions"".The FCA says people worried about their finances should go to a government-backed organisation, Moneyhelper. But Moneyhelper is an advice service, and can only offer guidance on how to survive when your savings vanish.With some mainstream investments it's possible to receive compensation if an institution collapses - for example a bank or building society - through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)But the FSCS says it doesn't protect crypto assets, as they are not a regulated financial product in the UK - all it can do is warn consumers of the risks, and provide tools to check if their investment is protected by the scheme.The organisation says crypto currency is something that consumers ask about every week, either via its customer service team, social media or searching for information on its website.It says ""crypto"" is one of the most popular words searched for on its website.Daniel Seely, financial services associate for law firm Freeths, told the BBC: ""The short answer is that there isn't much recourse available.""With a few exceptions, crypto assets fall largely outside the scope of regulators and watchdogs - for example, the Financial Ombudsman Service - and so consumers ""don't have a clear right to recourse in the same way they may with other products"". Consumers, argued Mr Seely, could consider pursuing civil claims against parties involved in an investment, such as brokers or financial advisers if they were used, ""but realistically if it is just a case that the investments didn't go as planned, there is currently little they can do to recoup losses"".The Financial Services and Markets Bill currently being scrutinised by parliament will begin to bring in some additional regulation for crypto, but in the meantime Mr Seely said it remained a ""very risky area for consumers looking to invest"".Haider Rafique - from OKX, a crypto exchange -  said there were some steps consumers could take to protect themselves against similar losses in the future, in particular by thinking carefully about where they stored their assets.""Unless they are active traders, we encourage our customers to store their crypto currencies on a non-custodial decentralised wallet,""he said.""In the industry we say: 'Not your keys, not your crypto.' Recent events prove it has never been truer.""Benjamin Dean, director of WisdomTree Investments, an asset management firm, urged people to think about investments in blockchain-related technology the same way they would more conventional assets, like stocks, shares or gold.""Do not invest more money than you can afford to lose, and never invest your money with companies which operate unregulated, off-shore exchanges"", he advised.""If you do not research where you are investing your money, then you are running a very high risk of losing all your investment.""Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy for consumer group Which? warned: ""Crypto assets are very high-risk and speculative. Investors face losing all their money if they decide to buy them, as they often come with limited consumer protections.""","Experts and watchdogs warn UK investors that when crypto firms fail, getting money back is unlikely.",https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63624894,/news/technology
21,Amazon staff laid off as tech giants cut costs,"Technology giant Amazon has started laying off staff, according to LinkedIn posts by workers who say they have been impacted by job cuts.This week it was reported that the company is planning to cut 10,000 jobs, or around 3% of its office staff.Amazon did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.It comes as thousands of jobs are being shed across the technology industry as firms see sales slow amid growing concerns about an economic downturn.Posts seen by the BBC include those from employees in Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant business, Luna cloud gaming platform division and Lab126 - the operation behind the Kindle e-reader.One employee, who said that she worked as a software development engineer in the US, posted that she was looking for a new job: ""Due to the nature of my visa, I have a limited time to lookout for new work opportunities.""Another Amazon worker who said they had been impacted by the layoffs said: ""Of course I am saddened, yet optimistic about the future because I know this means good change for me and others on my team.""The company had already introduced a hiring freeze and halted some of its warehouse expansions, warning it had over-hired during the pandemic. It had also taken steps to shut some parts of its business, cancelling projects such as a personal delivery robot.Last month Amazon's founder and chairman Jeff Bezos warned that the US economy was sending a signal to ""batten down the hatches"".Amazon's share price has fallen by more than 40% this year as it grapples with a slowdown in online sales. Other major technology companies have already announced major layoffs as they cut costs.Last week Meta - which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp - announced that it would cut 13% of its workforce.The first mass lay-offs in the firm's history will result in 11,000 employees losing their jobs.Shortly after Elon Musk took over Twitter it was confirmed that he would cut the social media platform's headcount by around 50%.In recent weeks technology giant Microsoft, payment processing platform Stripe and cloud-based business software firm Salesforce have also announced layoffs.One Seattle-based technology industry insider, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC that the job market had changed significantly in recent weeks.""The last two years has been great for job opportunities because of remote work meaning you don't have to isolate a job search to your local area. So that's seen the scramble for talent be very competitive and wages have gone up really high.""""What we're seeing now is a contraction in budgets and staffing.""He said some technology firms companies, including Amazon, are likely to be hit particularly hard.""Amazon is very, very bloated. So there's lots of people there but they're not providing a lot of value so they're first on the chopping block.""","This week it was reported that the firm is planning to cut 10,000 jobs, around 3% of its office staff.",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63631877,/news/technology

It has also faced competition from rivals such as Uber Eats and Menulog.Deliveroo said it had stopped accepting orders through its app, with customers receiving an error message if they tried to place an order.""This was a difficult decision and not one we have taken lightly. We want to thank all our employees, consumers, riders and restaurant and grocery partners who have been involved with the Australian operations over the past seven years,"" Deliveroo's chief operating officer Eric French said in a statement to investors.""Our focus is now on making sure our employees, riders and partners are supported throughout this process,"" he added.In the statement the company pledged ""guaranteed enhanced severance payments for employees as well as compensation for riders and for certain restaurant partners.""Food delivery apps saw demand surge during the pandemic but have since faced challenges including customers reining in their spending and the tightening of regulations in several countries.During Australia's election campaign this year Anthony Albanese, who is now the country's prime minister, said he would work to improve the rights of workers if his party came to power.Members of his government have called gig work a ""cancer"" on the economy with accusations that it drives down the wages of a million workers. Last month, Deliveroo also announced that it planned to quit the Netherlands market at the end of November.Deliveroo's London-listed shares have lost around half of their value since the start of this year.",The firm struggled to compete with rivals as well as facing pressure to improve workers' conditions.,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63645765,/news/technology
23,India tech workers fight back amid mass layoffs,"Thousands of young Indians are suddenly staring at an uncertain future as technology companies and start-ups announce mass layoffs due to global headwinds and funding crunches. But many are refusing to stay quiet about it.In October, when Ravi (name changed on request) realised that he and several colleagues were likely to lose their jobs with a major Indian edtech firm, he immediately set up a  private messaging group with them.The group soon became a ""safe space"" for Ravi and his teammates to air their fears, share tips on dealing with the management and discuss labour laws and workers' rights. ""It helped many in the team negotiate better exit policies with the company,"" Ravi says.The past few months have been difficult for Indian workers in private companies - especially in the tech sector. Edtech firms Byju's and Unacademy have cut hundreds of jobs; social media giant Twitter has laid off more than half of its staff in India and Indians are among those affected after Meta - Facebook's parent company - shaved off about 13% of its 87,000-strong workforce.The spate of layoffs has sparked outrage on social media and many of those affected are turning to the internet -  like their counterparts in other countries - to air their dissatisfaction and form support networks. They're tweeting about unceremonious firings, asking for jobs on LinkedIn, and using messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Slack to rally colleagues, assert their rights and share information with journalists.This is partly because the culture of shame and silence that once existed around redundancies in India is gradually wearing thin as mass layoffs become more common. Pritha Dutt, a management and development sector professional, says that even a couple of decades ago, terminations were most likely chalked up to ""a performance issue"".""Today, layoffs and downsizing have become accepted business practices, so terminations are no longer a taboo topic,"" she says.And while the jury is still out on how effective social media is as a tool for redressal, experts say that it is helping unite and amplify voices, especially as trade unions are no longer as powerful as they used to be. While millions of Indian workers still belong to trade unions, the movement as a whole has been weakening for years. A number of factors - including burgeoning private sector jobs, new labour reforms and a rise in contractual work - have played a role in denting their membership and might.""Along with employers making themselves more accessible, social media too is giving employees a platform to air their grievances, thereby reducing the need for a mediator - a role traditionally played by unions,"" says Professor Chandrasekhar Sripada at the Indian School of Business.After Byju's announced in October that it would ""rationalise"" about 2,500 employees to ""achieve profitability"", many of its employees have been speaking to the media - often anonymously - about the company culture and the pressures they face. Sacked Twitter employees have taken to social media to vent their frustrations. ""Always a Tweep never a Twit,"" tweeted one former employee in a veiled reference to new owner Elon Musk's Twitter bio at the time. ""Got fired without even a confirmation email. There's always a new low,"" said another.With the job market expanding, Ms Dutt says employees have become more confident about the marketability of their skills and don't mind standing up for their rights, even if that means burning bridges by calling out a person or organisation on social media.And this public outrage can sometimes help, like pushing employers to apologise for firing staff in an insensitive manner or for promoting a toxic work culture. But Ms Dutt cautions that this success could be limited and short-lived. The option may also not be available to everyone - many still fear speaking out as they worry it might jeopardise future job prospects, or invoke legal action from their employer.That's why many employees are also looking for other ways to air their grievances and fight for their rights. In the southern city of Thiruvananthapuram, 140 Byju's employees who alleged they were being forced to resign went on a protest and also met a Kerala state minister, who announced an investigation into the matter - the state is governed by a coalition of Left parties, which advocates for workers' rights.Days later, Byju's said it had reversed its decision to shut down operations at Thiruvananthapuram.Three former employees at an edtech firm told the BBC on condition of anonymity that they were working with a trade union to negotiate severance and notice periods with the company. Suman Dasmahapatra, president of the Bangalore chapter of the All India IT & ITeS Employees' Union - a registered trade union that has been assisting hundreds of tech employees with labour disputes since 2018 - said that the organisation's membership has been steadily growing. He concedes that this is still tiny compared with the total number of employees - a majority of IT sector professionals, he says, are still uncomfortable being part of trade unions, either because they fear reprisal from the management, or because ""they don't see themselves as 'workers'"".But Mr Dasmahapatra says he is confident that India will see a resurgence in unionisation as the push and pull of global economic forces make the job market more volatile.Over the past couple of years, US giants such as Amazon, Starbucks and Apple have seen their workers form unions and observers say calls for unionisation are likely to grow louder, and spread across industries. Prof Sripada, however, disagrees. He says that the proliferation and strengthening of trade unions need not become the norm, as workplaces have already become more conscious about adopting progressive, people-centric policies. ""Unions are a product of bad people management. When employers fail, unions rise. Employers today have the benefit of hindsight so the responsibility lies with them to make people management the centre of business,"" he says.""But if organisations continue laying off people in an insensitive and callous manner - as we're seeing happen frequently - the story might be different.""",,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-63619920,/news/technology
24,Google to pay record $391m privacy settlement,"Google will pay $391.5m (Â£330m) to settle allegations about how it collects data from users.The technology giant tracked the location of users who opted out of location services on their devices, 40 US states said.Google has been told to be transparent about location tracking in the future and develop a web page telling people about the data it collects.It is the largest privacy-related multi-state settlement in US history.A Google official said: ""Consistent with improvements we've made in recent years, we have settled this investigation, which was based on outdated product policies that we changed years ago.""Last month, Google agreed to pay Arizona $85m over similar issues concerning how it collects location data.There remains one outstanding case on the topic in the US courts, after Texas, Indiana, Washington and the District of Columbia took legal action against Google in January.Knowing a user's location helps advertisers target products.And location services help Google generate $200bn in annual advertising revenue.Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, who led the case - alongside Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson - said: ""For years Google has prioritised profit over its users' privacy. ""It has been crafty and deceptive. ""Consumers thought they had turned off their location-tracking features on Google - but the company continued to secretly record their movements and use that information for advertisers.""The attorneys general said Google had been misleading consumers about location tracking since at least 2014, breaking state consumer-protection laws.The company has been told to significantly improve user controls and the way it discloses location tracking, starting from 2023.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63635380,/news/technology
25,Biggest crypto exchange urges new industry rules,"The head of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange has told global leaders new regulations are needed.Binance chief Changpeng Zhao was speaking at a conference in Bali, Indonesia, attended by heads of the G20 group of nations.The company has also announced plans for a recovery fund to help struggling crypto businesses.It follows the bankruptcy of the FTX exchange, which shook the industry and wiped billions off the crypto market.The failure of the rival exchange, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, has left many small investors worried they face big losses.""We're in a new industry, we've seen in the past week, things go crazy in the industry,"" Mr Zhao, known as CZ, said, according to the Reuters news agency. ""We do need some regulations, we do need to do this properly, we do need to do this in a stable way.""But crypto companies also had responsibilities, Mr Zhao said.""The industry collectively has a role to protect consumers, to protect everybody. So it's not just regulators,"" he said.In many countries, cryptoassets are lightly regulated compared with other financial sectors, with few protections for consumers.The UK government has previously announced plans to regulate stablecoins, which, as the name suggests, are designed to have a stable value linked to traditional currencies or assets such as gold.Mr Zhao said the recovery fund - for otherwise strong companies unable to find enough cash, or assets that can be easily converted into cash, to cover their immediate needs - would reduce the risk of ""cascading negative effects"" following FTX's bankruptcy.Binance's announcement it would offload its holdings of FTX's cryptocurrency, FTT, and its subsequent abandonment of a rescue deal for the troubled exchange - after carrying out due diligence checks - were factors in FTX's collapse, which wiped an estimated $200bn (Â£170bn) off the crypto market in a matter of days.And it is now feared other crypto businesses could be at risk, as investors withdraw funds.Meanwhile UK MPs on the Commons Treasury Select Committee were able to quiz business figures, including Binance, as part of their inquiry into the cryptoasset industry.Daniel Trinder, Binance vice-president of government affairs in Europe, denied that the company's actions had contributed to the collapse of FTX.That, he alleged, was caused by ""failures around governance, around risk management, around excessive leverage, about, if we believe the reports, inappropriate use of clients' assets"".Instead Binance had been trying to rescue FTX, realising the implications for the wider industry.He told MPs that the exchange ""started that due diligence process and realised something was very wrong and we pulled out of it"".The incident, he argued, showed the need for regulation.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63624890,/news/technology
26,Amazon 'prepares mass job cuts' as sales slow,"Amazon is preparing to cut thousands of office jobs amid slowing sales and concerns about an economic downturn, according to reports.The reductions could affect roughly 3% of office staff at the e-commerce giant - or about 10,000 people - US media reported, citing anonymous sources.The cuts are expected to affect divisions such as personal devices and e-commerce.Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.The company had already introduced a hiring freeze and halted some of its warehouse expansions, warning it had over-hired during the pandemic. It has also taken steps to shut some parts of its business, cancelling projects such as a personal delivery robot.Last week, the company said that reducing expenses would be a focus in its annual review of business operations. ""As part of this year's review, we're of course taking into account the current macro-environment and considering opportunities to optimize costs,"" the company said in a statement then. The exact number of jobs that will be cut remains fluid, according to media reports.Amazon has been grappling with a slowdown in online sales after business boomed during the pandemic.Though overall revenue rose 15% in the most recent quarter, the firm has remained cautious about the outlook as the slowdown expands into other areas, including its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, which has long powered its profits.Founder Jeff Bezos, who has stepped down as chief executive but remains chairman of the board, has said on social media that it was a time to ""batten down the hatches"".Amazon joins a string of other tech companies that have announced job cuts, warning of a downturn in the economy. The list includes Meta, parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, who also recently said it would cut 11,000 jobs - the biggest reduction in its history or roughly 13% of its workforce. Overall US-based tech companies shed more than 28,000 jobs so far this year, more than double a year earlier according to a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks such announcements.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63628187,/news/technology
27,The fall of ‘King of Crypto’ Sam Bankman-Fried,"It took fewer than eight days for Sam Bankman-Fried to go from being nicknamed the ""King Of Crypto"" to his company filing for bankruptcy and him stepping down as chief executive, facing federal investigations into how he handled the company's finances.Over the last few years, the internet has been flooded with long interviews with him, speaking over video chat from his office desk in the Bahamas.In some of them, there's a distracting clicking noise. As his interviewees listen intently to his incredible story of how he became a multibillionaire in five years, the sound is persistent and clearly coming from the American entrepreneur's mouse.""Click, click, click,"" it goes, in rapid, on-off bursts.Meanwhile, Mr Bankman-Fried's eyes dart around the screen.It's not clear from the videos what he's doing on his computer, but his tweets can give us a pretty good clue.""I'm (in)famous for playing League of Legends while on phone calls,"" he tweeted in February 2021.Mr Bankman-Fried - the former boss of embattled cryptocurrency exchange FTX - is an avid gamer. And in a series of tweets to his nearly one million followers, he explained why. Playing the team fantasy battle game was his way to get his mind to switch off from running two companies trading billions of dollars a day.""Some people drink too much; some gamble. I play League,"" he said.Since the 30-year-old's cryptocurrency empire collapsed this week in dramatic fashion, another anecdote about his gaming has resurfaced online.According to a blog post from venture capital giant Sequoia Capital, Mr Bankman-Fried played an intense League of Legends battle during a high-level video call with their investment team.It didn't seem to put them off at all, though. The group proceeded to invest $210m in Mr Bankman-Fried's company FTX.This week, Sequoia Capital deleted that gushing blog post and announced it is now writing off their FTX investment as a loss.The firm is not the only investor to have lost eye-watering amounts of money since Mr Bankman-Fried's $32bn empire collapsed.FTX had an estimated 1.2 million registered users who were using the exchange to buy cryptocurrency tokens such as Bitcoin and thousands of others.From large traders to everyday crypto fans, many are left wondering if they will ever get back their savings trapped in FTX's digital wallets.It's a dizzying downfall and the rise of Mr Bankman-Fried is also its own dramatic story of risks, rewards and beanbags. Mr Bankman-Fried went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - a prestigious US research university where he studied physics and maths. But the young bright undergraduate says it was lessons learned in the student dorms that led him on his path to getting rich.In a BBC radio interview last month, he recalled being swept up in the ""effective altruism"" movement. Effective altruism is a community of people ""trying to figure out what practical things you can do with your life to have as much positive impact as you can on the world"", he said.So, as Mr Bankman-Fried recalls, he decided to get into banking to make as much money as he could to give it back to good causes.He learned to trade stocks during a short stint at trading firm Jane Street in New York before he got bored and decided to experiment with Bitcoin.He noticed the variations in the value of Bitcoin across different cryptocurrency exchanges and started arbitraging - buying Bitcoin from places selling it cheap and selling to other places where it was trading for more. After a month of making modest profits, he got together with some college friends and started a trading business called Alameda Research.Mr Bankman-Fried says it wasn't easy and took months of perfecting techniques about how to move money in and out of banks and across borders. But after around three months, he and his small team hit the jackpot.""We were super-dogged,"" he said to the Jax Jones and Martin Warner Show podcast a year ago. ""We just kept going. If someone throws another roadblock, we would be creative, and if our system couldn't handle that, we would just build a new system to get us through that hoop."" By January 2018, his team were making $1m every day. A business reporter at CNBC asked him recently how that felt. Intellectually and according to his methodology, he said, ""it made perfect"" sense. ""But viscerally, it surprised me every day,"" he said.Sam Bankman-Fried became an official billionaire in 2021, thanks to his secondary and more high-profile business, FTX. The crypto exchange grew to be the second largest in the world and a titan of the industry, seeing $10-$15bn traded a day.In early 2022, FTX was valued at $32bn and a household name, with an NBA stadium named after the company and endorsements from celebrity backers such as the NFL's Tom Brady.All the while, Mr Bankman-Fried seemingly delighted in giving his Twitter followers an insight into his lifestyle. He mainly sleeps on a beanbag next to his desk in the office, he said, with a picture of him lying next to his staff at their trading terminals. In another, he posted in the early hours of the morning. ""Couldn't sleep. Back to the office,"" he wrote.Mr Bankman-Fried's dream of giving away vast amounts of money to charity was also well under way. In the BBC radio interview last month, he claimed he had given away ""a few hundred million as of now"".And his generosity didn't just extend to charities. In the last six months, the ""King of Crypto"" was given another nickname - ""Crypto's White Knight"". With the price of cryptocurrencies falling in 2022, the so-called ""Crypto Winter"" is in full swing. While other companies in the industry faltered, Mr Bankman-Fried was handing out bailout cash in the hundreds of millions.Asked why he was trying to prop up failing crypto firms, he told CNBC: ""It's not going to be good long-term if we have real pain and real blow outs. And it's not fair to customers."" He also claimed, in the same interview, to have $2bn in reserve that he could use to help failing crypto companies. But last week, he was going around the same industry himself, trying to raise money to save his own company and customers.Questions about the real financial stability of FTX began swirling after an article on the CoinDesk website suggested that much of Mr Bankman-Fried's trading giant Alameda Research rests on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company of FTX invented, not an independent asset. Further accusations that Alameda Research used FTX's customer deposits as loans for trading were made in the Wall Street Journal.The beginning of the end came though when FTX's main competitor - Binance - publicly sold off all its crypto tokens linked to FTX a few days later.Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao told his 7.5 million followers his company would be selling off the holdings ""in light of recent revelations"".It sparked a run on FTX, with panicked customers withdrawing billions of dollars from the cryptocurrency exchange. Withdrawals were halted and Mr Bankman-Fried tried to get a bailout, with Binance at one stage publicly considering a buyout before walking away.Binance said reports of ""mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations"" had swayed its decision.A day later, FTX was declared bankrupt.Mr Bankman-Fried apologised in a series of tweets saying: ""I'm really sorry, again, that we ended up here.""Hopefully things can find a way to recover. Hopefully this can bring some amount of transparency, trust and governance to them.""He also said he ""was shocked to see things unravel the way they did"".So was, and is, the crypto world. The price of Bitcoin has fallen to a two-year low and many are wondering - if FTX can go down along with its talismanic leader, what could fall next?Have you been affected by the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX?

28,What to do with 18 shipping containers of rotting cabbages,"Not many people would know what to do with 18 containers filled with rotting cabbages.But Jake Slinn does.The 23-year-old founder of JS Global operates in the cargo salvage industry - a small but essential cog in the machinery of global trade.Last year one of the larger cogs in that machine got stuck in the Suez Canal. The world's biggest container ship, the Ever Given, blocked the key shipping lane for six days in March.Part of that ship's cargo was the 18 containers, each weighing 20 tonnes, of cabbages that ended up with Mr Slinn. His Ipswich-based firm organised their delivery to an anaerobic digestion plant, where they were turned into fuel.Cargo may need to be salvaged for a wide variety of reasons. Like the Ever Given cabbages, some goods may perish during their journey and need to be destroyed. Local authorities may deem goods unsafe and order their destruction - a particular problem when Covid-19 hit.""During the pandemic we destroyed tens of thousands of items of fake PPE, mainly fake masks and fake gloves, that had been imported from China,"" says Mr Slinn, whose parents are in the waste management business.It's not only damaged or unsafe cargo that needs to be salvaged.If a business goes bust, its cargo may be stranded at a port somewhere. If goods are delayed, they miss a key deadline, like Christmas, and may be abandoned.Cargo can even be unwanted because the cost of storing the items at the port or in a nearby warehouse exceeds its value to its owner.In such cases, a salvage company will often step in and find new buyers.Paul and Poppy Vidler of UK-based Crown Salvage have decades of experience of finding buyers for unwanted goods.The company recently acquired containers of easy-to-assemble housing units and have been working on finding buyers.""We sourced them from Turkey and have been having conversations with lots of people, from places like La Palma after the volcano [eruption in 2021] as well as Ghana.""They can be set up quickly wherever there's a housing problem,"" says Mr Vidler.More technology of business:With a big database of buyers around the world, they can take on large quantities of industrial goods, including chemicals and plastics.""We're larger and global, it's not like that reality TV programme,"" Mrs Vidler explains, referring to US hit show Storage Wars, where contestants bid on storage units with the goal of profiting from the abandoned goods inside them.The salvage companies say their work is good for the environment.""We don't send anything to the landfill, not just because it's not good for the environment, but it's also not cost-effective,"" Mr Slinn says.Mrs Vidler agrees. ""We're not greenwashing. What we do actually helps avoid these things ending up in landfill.""Aside from these environmental benefits, a more immediate benefit is that salvaging these goods helps release the handbrake on global trade, emptying containers that can then go back into circulation.""We'll empty a container in the morning and it's already going back out on a ship empty by the afternoon,"" Mr Slinn says.Getting containers back into circulation was a particularly pressing issue in the immediate aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.In September 2021 the price of a 40ft (12m) container hit a high of almost $10,400 (Â£9,160), according to the World Container Index produced by analysts Drewry.Since then the price has fallen back to around $2,773, well below the five-year average of around $3,759 according to the Index.For those in the cargo salvage industry, delays, financial turmoil and strikes can all provide opportunities.Recent industrial action in Felixstowe, the UK's largest container port resulted in an increase in abandoned cargo. Mr Slinn disposed of a container of pork, which was due to be exported from the UK, but perished because the ship picking it up couldn't dock at the port.""A lot of people were abandoning their stock because of the shutdown. It was a frustrating period for a lot of people but a good thing for us,"" Mr Slinn says.Anything that makes life difficult for companies, like soaring energy prices, raises the likelihood that containers will be stranded.Companies may be unable to afford the increased cost of storing goods in warehouses, while others may go out of business altogether, leaving their goods unwanted and stuck.A tough economic environment provides opportunities for the salvage industry, but also comes with risk.""There are also disasters we can be affected by,"" Mrs Vidler says.Firms like hers rely on being able to connect buyers and sellers and being able to get goods to their destinations.Whilst there is always uncertainty, the business is never dull, according to Mr Slinn.""Every day is different, you never know what you're going to be dealing with.""",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62979352,/news/technology
29,'Digital newsletters really humanise you to your readers',"Author Elle Griffin says she would definitely turn down a book deal if she was ever offered one.""I'd never accept oneâ¦ traditional book publishing is full of bad math, and even worse marketing,"" says the 37-year-old writer of gothic novels.Last year, instead of releasing her first book, called Obscurity, as physical copies in High Street bookstores, or as a Kindle version to download, she started to self-publish chapters as email instalments.Using online publishing platform Substack, the new chapters were emailed out every week or two to Ms Griffin's subscribers. She already had more than 3,000 non-paying followers before she started to release the book, as she had for a number of years been writing articles on numerous topics.But by the end of the first 12 months of her novel's serialisation her subscriber numbers had more than doubled, thanks to recommendations from readers and other Substack account holders.Based in Salt Lake City, Utah, Ms Griffin now has 6,843 subscribers, and, crucially, 301 paying ones.They are charged from $10 (Â£8.60) a month, or $50 per annum, and Ms Griffin says in the first year she earned nearly $18,000.With many of us spending more time online than ever before, writing coach Nancy Erickson says it makes sense for novelists like Ms Griffin to focus on offering readers direct digital access to their work.""What you really want to do is meet your audience wherever they're already engaged,"" says Ms Erickson, who is based in St Louis, Missouri. She adds that digital engagement ""helps authors build their brands, as well as finding other revenue generating activities"".Jane Ostler is executive vice president of global thought leadership at brand consulting company Kantar. She sees online serialisation as an effective form of digital marketing, a way for new writers to get themselves better known. ""I think there is a lot of potential here for a new writer,"" she says.While prolific Nottingham-based author Kristina Adams hasn't serialised any of her 16 self-published novels and three non-fiction titles, she has been sending free weekly digital newsletters about literature and life to subscribers since 2014. This was two years before the now 32-year-old released her first book.She continues to send these emails out to more than 2,500 people via a service called MailerLite. They include stories about things referenced in her books, talks about her dog Millie, and promotion of upcoming releases.""Digital newsletters in particular, I think more than social media, really humanise you to your readers,"" says Ms Adams, who writes romance titles under her full name, and ghost stories as KC Adams. ""It gives you a much closer connection.""And sending out the newsletters really makes a different to sales. Every time I sent one out I get an up-turn in sales.""You can think that you are sending out far too many, but in most cases only about a fifth of people will open each email. So while you think you are shouting and demanding attention, most subscribers wouldn't see it that way.""Back in Salt Lake City, Ms Griffin is now serialising her second novel. She says she was inspired to release her book in instalments by 19th Century French writer Alexandre Dumas.Like her, he wrote gothic fiction, and his well-known novel The Count of Monte Cristo was serialised in a Parisian weekly newspaper in the 1840s.New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.As is the norm for Substack, people can read the chapters of Ms Griffin's novels for free via her page on the app and website.However, paying subscribers get extra benefits, such as the ability to read Ms Griffin's commentaries, post their own thoughts, chat with other subscribers, and even write and publish their own essays.Ms Griffin says all this feedback is very helpful.""Recently, two readers mentioned that they wished my chapters were longer, so I started making them longer,"" she says. ""I love being able to respond in real-time.""Ms Griffin adds that she had researched self-publishing her books in digital form via Amazon, but that her subscription model is far more lucrative.She explains the maths. ""Say I sold 1,000 books on Amazon, then I'd make $1,000, maybe more, maybe $5,000.""But if I - instead of just selling it - adopted a subscription model, and charged readers $8 or $9 a month, then from the same 1,000 fans, I could presumably make $100,000 in salary.""She adds that with a traditional book deal she'd be even worse off financially, as she'd likely only get a royalty rate of around 15% of revenues.In addition to the subscription payments, Ms Griffin's followers can pay to buy and download the digital artwork that she designs for each chapter.""I think the beauty of it [serialisation] is you can start grassroots, and start from the bottom,"" she says. ""I'm not Stephen King, I'm just barely getting started.""Additional reporting by Will Smale",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63565577,/news/technology
30,Why smart thermostats don't always save you money,"A few years ago, Dominic McCann realised that his smart thermostat was a treasure trove of data. So he decided to hack it, in order to track what his boiler was doing literally every minute of the day.Using open source software, he accessed data from the thermostat online and plotted graphs that charted boiler activity against the changing temperature of a particular room. And when he upgraded the bi-folding door in his dining room to a triple-glazed model, the system instantly captured the difference that made.""I could quickly get a handle on, 'Oh, if I do this, I've saved this amount of energy,'"" he recalls. Insights like this helped him to save money, over time.Mr McCann, who lives in Manchester, was aided by his technical background. He is director of Azymuth Acoustics UK, a noise assessment firm. When he first tinkered with his thermostat, back in 2019, he was arguably in a small minority. But with rocketing energy prices, and the associated cost-of-living crisis, more people are turning to their smart thermostats seeking answers to the question: how do I reduce my energy bill?Generally speaking, a smart thermostat is a connected version of a traditional central heating controller - one you can program and adjust via a smartphone or tablet app, or smart speaker. Manufacturers have long touted these gadgets as money savers. Over the years, they have certainly provided increasingly detailed information about users' energy consumption and offered partially automated heating control. And yet there is still debate over how beneficial smart thermostats are, with some research indicating that installing one doesn't always result in reduced energy use.Google Nest, Honeywell, Drayton Wiser, Tado, Hive - all these brands say their systems make it easier to manage your heating. And many offer to learn how you heat your home, or detect when you're out, and respond automatically in an effort to curtail usage and save you money.Mr McCann was arguably ahead of his time. In response to the cost-of-living crisis, smart thermostat maker Tado recently launched a software update that provides monthly bill predictions to help users keep within a budget. There are also room-by-room comparisons so people can see which rooms in their home require the most heating.A spokesman for Tado says that the ""vast majority"" of its users are able to save money with its system.There are more than 75 million smart thermostats installed worldwide and this number is expected to more than double by 2025, according to Neil Barbour, an industry analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence. He cites research from The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, which estimated that smart thermostats enable a roughly 10% reduction in home heating and cooling per household. With that in mind, Mr Barbour and his colleagues have calculated that the US could reduce its total energy consumption by 45.4 terawatt hours - roughly the same amount of energy used by the entire state of Mississippi in 2020 - if every home with a heating, ventilation and cooling system installed a smart thermostat by 2026.That would be quite a saving. But the research on how people actually use these devices paints a mixed picture. One study of Honeywell smart thermostat data from 1,379 households in California, published in September, found that users generally undid the benefits of the gadgets by manually overriding their scheduled programme of heating or cooling. In other words, it was easy to boost the heating, for example, which meant some people eroded their energy savings.However, a separate analysis published in 2020 of data from 20,000 Ecobee smart thermostats in the US found that users sometimes overrode their device's schedule in a way that used less energy. So manual interventions, overall, were not as costly as expected. The study was part-funded by Ecobee.Smart thermostats may struggle when users expect them to do all the work for them, suggests the lead author of the second study, Brent Huchuk, who now works for tech firm PassiveLogic.According to him, someone who is good at tweaking their own system is likely to do better than a smart thermostat.""It's pretty hard to beat someone who's actively managing [their] heating and cooling schedule,"" he says.He also notes that the automatic interventions of smart thermostats will be limited when people work from home, since that reduces the number of opportunities the smart device has to shut the heating off. There are also technical quirks to be aware of. In the UK, for instance, some highly energy efficient boilers on the market can modulate (adjust up or down) how much energy they use, in response to the amount of heating required.But to take full advantage of this, you have to choose a smart thermostat that is fully compatible with your specific model of boiler. The Heating Hub, an independent consumer advice organisation, has published details about this online.""It's such a minefield for households,"" says founder Jo Alsop.In the future, smart thermostats could theoretically track energy prices in real-time and allow people to heat their homes when it is cheapest to do so, suggests Dr Huchuk. A 2017 study by Enrico Costanza at University College, London, and colleagues, experimented with exactly this idea. Participants received specially designed thermostats that displayed sample pricing data moment-by-moment.That might be a little too much information for many. But the study suggested that, across multiple households, this could prompt a reduction in overall energy consumption. Prof Costanza argues that, in reality, it would be more useful to give people information about their energy use over a longer period, say a month, or a forecast that explains how much someone could save by heating the house a little less in the morning, for example. ""Making it easier for people to understand how they spend energy can make a difference,"" says Prof Costanza.More technology of business:",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63511163,/news/technology
31,Why an old train could point to a clean energy future,"An old diesel freight train in British Columbia, Canada is about to get a new lease of life.Local firm Hydrogen in Motion (H2M) is currently converting the Green Goat locomotive to run on a mix of hydrogen and battery power.The so-called switcher locomotive performs tasks such as transporting small loads of lumber or animal feed at rail yards.If all goes to plan, H2M will have the engine running by the end of this year, or early next.""With the successful demonstration of this we would be looking at much larger trains as well,"" says H2M president and chief executive Grace Quan. ""We'd be looking at converting entire fleets.""Hydrogen, which emits water but no carbon dioxide when burned, is often touted as a fuel of the future. There are already a few hydrogen-powered trains out there, such as the ones currently being rolled out in the German state of Lower Saxony. The technology made its debut there in 2018.In the UK, a hydrogen locomotive, HydroFlex2, is undergoing testing in Long Marston, Warwickshire.But current methods of storing hydrogen in tanks, as a highly pressurised gas or extremely cold (cryogenic) liquid, are expensive and potentially unsafe. Scientists have long aimed to find ways of storing hydrogen in more inert solid forms.In H2M's case, the company has developed a nanomaterial within which hydrogen is stored at relatively low pressure compared to other techniques.By simply opening a valve and lowering the pressure, the hydrogen comes off, just like when the CO2 in a carbonated drink gets released when you open the bottle, says Ms Quan.She adds that hydrogen could be especially useful for powering heavy vehicles that go on long journeys, such as trains and lorries, though the company has also developed a hydrogen-powered three-wheeler tuk tuk as a small-scale demonstration.""Depending on the size of the fuel cell, we could give up to a week's worth of power,"" says Ms Quan of the tuk tuk.But she adds that sourcing investment funds to develop her firm's technology has not been easy. And many other solid state hydrogen storage solutions are at an early phase of development.Though some of them are exciting, the huge challenge they face is to prove that they are commercially viable and worth choosing over, say, batteries for certain applications.Duncan Gregory at the University of Glasgow says that those working on hydrogen storage technology at the moment are aiming to achieve a density of 5 wt% (weight per cent) or greater within the storage medium. ""It's really difficult to get to that,"" he explains.There's plenty of effort, though. Take the method that Ian Chen at Deakin University in Australia and colleagues are currently beavering away on. It involves a technique called ball milling, a sort of grinding process using tiny balls inside a canister. This grinding activity raises pressure levels, encouraging gases to become absorbed by a powder inside the canister.Prof Chen and his colleagues have found that they can use this to store gases including hydrogen in boron nitride powder.""We like it because it's stable, it's not toxic, it's lightweight,"" says Prof Chen, who adds that 5 wt% should be possible with this method.In July, the team described how this process could be used to store hydrocarbons in an academic paper. The detail of experiments in which they managed to store hydrogen and other gases such as CO2 and ammonia are yet to be made public.Prof Chen is enthused by the possibility of storing hydrogen in this form, which simply requires the application of heat to release the gas again. But he admits that a long road lies between this research and commercial success.More technology of business:The team would need to design large-scale equipment and show that the method would be truly cost-effective at scale. ""We don't claim that we have solved all the major problems,"" says Prof Chen.The cost challenges were underlined in October when the German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg ruled out replacing diesel locomotives with hydrogen-powered trains.A study commissioned by the state concluded that the installation of overhead electricity lines or battery hybrid trains provided much better value for money over a 30-year period.Prof Gregory, who is currently working with a separate, undisclosed firm on hydrogen technology, adds that one of the potential issues with the ball milling process is how long it takes. The small-scale experiments reported by Prof Chen and his colleagues so far took 20 hours of milling.Besides transportation, hydrogen stored in a solid state could have other uses. A trial currently under way in Scotland will test hydrogen generation and storage on one of the Orkney IslandsA machine-learning system will monitor weather patterns and decide when to use electricity from nearby wind turbines to power the electrolysis process, which is how hydrogen is extracted from water.""It's a good test bed,"" says Enass Abo-Hamed, chief executive and co-founder of H2GO Power. ""You could have a week full of wind and then a week with nothing.""The system will also determine when the hydrogen would best be released or stored, in this case within a powder-like substance. This stored energy would provide a potential resource during wind droughts.A lack of wind has, unfortunately, helped to push up UK energy prices this year.Although it's not yet certain that the system on Orkney will actually be connected to the local grid during the trial, Dr Abo-Hamed says it is a possibility and, if so, the hydrogen could be used to power up to 70 homes. In the future it could also, in theory, be converted back into a gas state and used for domestic heating.Hydrogen has potential as a boiler fuel that would be cleaner than natural gas, argues Prof Gregory, though there are significant challenges in implementing this, too.Recent studies have cast doubt on hydrogen's potential as a fuel, both in terms of heating and transportation. Prof Gregory argues that, if someone can crack the hydrogen storage problem, then that could fundamentally change how we power the world's vehicles - from freight trains to cars.""I can see in 20 years' time or whatever, when somebody eventually comes up with a material that will do this job, I reckon batteries could well be superseded by hydrogen,"" he says.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62619313,/news/technology
32,The Indian-American 'helping' Elon Musk run Twitter,"Twitter's new owner Elon Musk has whipped up a storm after he sacked thousands of employees last week.The controversial way the firings happened - with many employees discovering they had been laid off when they were shut out of their emails - sparked anger, frustration and even lawsuits against Mr Musk. Among those sacked were some of the firm's most senior executives. In their place, Mr Musk has reportedly put together a small team of his own - of friends and confidantes - and entrusted them with the job of implementing his vision for Twitter. They appear to include Sriram Krishnan, an Indian-origin software engineer and former Twitter executive who left the company last year. Last week, Mr Krishnan, who now works at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz or a16z, tweeted that he was ""helping out Mr Musk temporarily"". Since then, his name has been trending in India, where many are bitter about the unceremonious sacking of former CEO Parag Agrawal and other Indian-origin executives. It is not immediately clear in what capacity Mr Krishnan will be joining Twitter - the BBC contacted him for comment, but he said he ""can't help right now with anything Twitter-related"".It's also hard to say how close his association with Mr Musk is at this point, though reports have repeatedly described him as a part of his ""inner circle"". In a 2021 interview with Marina Mogilko, who runs a YouTube channel called Silicon Valley Girl, Mr Krishnan said he and his wife Aarthi Ramamurthy first got to know Mr Musk when he helped with ""something Twitter-related"" a few years ago and that they ""built a relationship through that"". The couple also met Mr Musk during a private tour of SpaceX's headquarters in California ""several years ago"", according to The New York Times. But the most prominent exchange between them came in February 2021 when Mr Musk appeared in a talk show the couple hosted on Clubhouse.Social media burst out with incredulity - the world's richest man had just showed up on an invite-only app for an exclusive - and the show began to trend heavily. Within minutes, the chatroom quickly hit the Clubhouse limit of 5,000 concurrent listeners as Mr Musk spoke about life on Mars, the possibility of aliens and about how one of his companies had wired up a monkey's brain to ""play video games with his mind"".The Good Time Show, which has since moved to other platforms, continues to be hugely popular in the US. The podcast offers a glimpse into the overlapping worlds of internet culture, politics and the latest developments in Silicon Valley, where Mr Krishnan and Ms Ramamurthy are well-known figures.Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of a16z, says that Mr Krishnan is ""perhaps the only person in the world to have served in senior product positions in the three biggest social platforms of our time"", according to the company website. In addition to Twitter, the 37-year-old worked at Microsoft, Yahoo, Snap and Facebook in the past. Ms Ramamurthy, meanwhile, worked at Facebook and Netflix before starting two of her own companies.  Together, they have been described as a well-connected ""tech power couple"".Mr Krishnan was born in the southern Indian city of Chennai in what he described as a ""very traditional"" middle-income household. His life changed when he convinced his father to buy him a computer - a luxury in the late 1990s. ""It cost about 60,000-70,000 rupees [$730-840; Â£638-744], a large part of my father's pay check,"" he told Ms Mogilko in the 2021 interview. ""I told him I would use it for my studies.""But he still did not have internet because a dial-up connection was expensive and unaffordable. So he would buy coding books instead to teach himself the basics, and practise every night. Mr Krishnan met Ms Ramamurthy online in 2002 while studying engineering at Anna University in Chennai. By then, he was already on the path to becoming a software engineer. So was Ms Ramamurthy, a student in the same college. ""A mutual friend wanted to start a coding project, so he decided to get the two nerdiest people he knew - me and Aarthi - on board,"" he told Ms Mogilko. The collaboration did not survive, but his and Ms Ramamurthy's relationship did. The couple continued to chat on Yahoo messenger for a year until they finally met in person.  In the months to come, the internet continued to be the foundation of their relationship as they ""idealised the myth of Silicon Valley"" as the future of American endeavour, and dreamed of being there someday. ""One of our first dates was watching bit-torrent copy of a 1999 Silicon Valley film in my tiny room,"" Mr Krishnan said in the interview. Their big break came a few months later when one of Mr Krishnan's blog posts on Microsoft was noticed by a company executive, who then hired the couple in 2005. In 2007, Mr Krishnan moved to the US and Ms Ramamurthy joined him six months later. Mr Krishnan has said in the past that it took them a while to get used to living there, but work continued to be their solace.After working at Microsoft, the couple moved on to other big tech companies. They got American citizenship in 2017, a moment Mr Krishnan has described in interviews as being on a par with their wedding and the birth of their first daughter. Last December, they started their career as podcasters - a decision born out of pandemic-fuelled boredom, Mr Krishnan has explained in the past.So, they decided to get on to Clubhouse, which became popular during the pandemic, to have conversations about the tech space. The interviews are woven with analysis and candid repartee with experts, including the likes of Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and the late fashion designer Virgil Aboh.While little is known about Mr Krishnan's ties with Mr Musk, he has been an open admirer of the billionaire in the past, describing him as an ""inspirational person and an iconic founder"". He has also openly supported Mr Musk's vision for Twitter and criticised practices such as de-platforming on the microblogging website. ""Having extrajudicial internet cops that lead to enforcement on your platform is the road to dystopian authoritarianism,"" he wrote on Twitter last month.There's speculation that Mr Musk might have got Mr Krishnan - a cryptocurrency expert - on board to integrate his dogecoin with Twitter. Whether Mr Krishnan will become the next ""Technoking"" (Mr Musk's alternative title for CEO) of Twitter or not, interesting times lie ahead for the social platform - and Mr Krishnan could be right in the middle of it.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-63481873,/news/technology
33,Nasa's Artemis Moon rocket lifts off Earth,"The American space agency Nasa has launched its most powerful ever rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The 100m-tall Artemis vehicle climbed skyward in a stupendous mix of light and sound.Its objective was to hurl an astronaut capsule in the direction of the Moon.This spacecraft, known as Orion, is uncrewed for this particular flight, but if everything works as it should, people will climb aboard for future missions that go to the lunar surface.Wednesday's flight followed two previous launch attempts in August and September that were aborted during the countdown because of technical woes.    But such issues were overcome on this occasion, and the Space Launch System, as the rocket is often called, was given the ""go"" to begin its ascent from the Kennedy Space Center at 01:47 local time (06:47 GMT).""Today, we got to witness the world's most powerful rocket take the Earth by its edges and shake the wicked out of it,"" said Mike Sarafin, Nasa's Artemis mission manager. ""We have a priority one mission in play right now."" His boss, the agency's administrator Bill Nelson, was also wowed.""That's the biggest flame I've ever seen. It's the most acoustical shockwave that I have ever experienced,"" he commented. ""I have to say what we saw tonight was an A+. But we have still a long ways to go. This is just a test flight.""The rocket had a number of important manoeuvres to perform high above the planet to get the Orion capsule on the right path to the Moon. All were performed ""outstandingly"", said John Honeycutt, Nasa's SLS programme manager. The ship will now rely on its European propulsion module to shepherd it safely on the rest of the mission.Josef Aschbacher is director general of the European Space Agency (Esa): ""We have to make sure that Orion is powered safely to the Moon, circles the Moon, and then, as you know, we have to bring it back safely to Earth, making sure that the entry of the capsule into the atmosphere is on the right trajectory and at the right angle so that it can land in the Pacific Ocean. Yes, our job starts now, and it's a huge responsibility.""December will see Nasa celebrate the 50th anniversary of Apollo 17, the very last time humans walked on the Moon.The space agency is calling its new programme Artemis (Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology).It's planning a series of ever more complex missions over the next decade that should result in a more sustained presence at Earth's satellite, with the presence of surface habitats and the use of rovers, together with a mini space station in orbit around the Moon.Nasa hopes will become an inspiration to a new generation. It has promised that women and people of colour will feature in these endeavours, something that didn't happen 50 years ago.""I wanted to be an astronaut from the time that I was five years old."" said astronaut Jessica Meir.  ""For anybody that has a dream or some kind of aspiration, if they see somebody that they can identify with a little bit, it puts them into a totally different perspective where they can say, 'Well, wait a minute, that person was just like me, and they did it so I can do it too'.""Analysis by Rebecca Morelle, BBC News Science EditorIn 1972, Apollo astronaut Gene Cernan left the last set of footprints on the Moon. As he departed from the lunar surface, he said he believed it wouldn't be long before we returned. It's been 50 years. But today, the Moon is within reach for humanity once again.With a roar of its mighty engines, Nasa's new rocket has lifted us into a new era for human spaceflight.Nasa's astronauts watched on - if this mission is a success, next time they will be onboard, first flying around the Moon, and then landing on it.But we're not there yet. The Orion spacecraft may be on its way, but it has more than a million miles of travel ahead. It has to reach the Moon, orbit around it, and then return home. Nasa has to show this system is safe before any astronauts can be strapped in for the ride.Orion is being sent on a 26-day excursion that will take it into what's called a distant retrograde orbit at the Moon.At its closest, the capsule will be a mere 100km from the lunar surface; at its most distant, Orion will be up to 70,000km (45,000 miles). This will be the furthest from Earth any human-rated spacecraft has ever ventured.The capsule is due back on Earth on 11 December - about three and a half weeks from now. That's when one of the key events in the whole mission occurs.Engineers are most concerned to learn that Orion's heatshield will cope with the extreme temperatures it will encounter on re-entry to our planet's atmosphere.The capsule will be coming in very fast - at 38,000km/h (24,000mph), or 32 times the speed of sound.A shield on its underside must cope with temperatures approaching 3,000C.The United Kingdom is playing its part in the Artemis adventure, and not just as a member state of the European Space Agency.On Wednesday, the Goonhilly Earth Station in Cornwall picked up the Orion ship's radio signal as it came off the top of the rocket. By analysing the shift in frequencies as the capsule moved through space, it enabled Nasa to more actually calculate the trajectory for a later course correction.Goonhilly will be sending commands to six of the 10 small satellites that were also lofted by the SLS rocket.""We started our company here less than 12 years ago with an ambition to do deep space communication,"" explained Goonhilly CEO Ian Jones.""We thought we'd be picking up scraps here and there by now, not to be actually commanding spacecraft on Nasa's first return to the Moon, which is brilliant.""",Nasa launches the most powerful rocket in its history as it kick-starts efforts to get humans back to the Moon.,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63643707,/news/science_and_environment
34,Egypt’s 'super coral' at risk in Red Sea,"As Egypt hosts world leaders at COP27 to discuss action over climate change, an oil terminal is dumping toxic wastewater on the country's Red Sea coast, an investigation by BBC News Arabic has found. A rare form of coral, that offers hope for preserving ocean life as the planet warms, could be a casualty.Leaked documents obtained by the BBC and non-profit journalism group SourceMaterial reveal that ""produced water"" from Egypt's Ras Shukeir oil terminal is being dumped into the Red Sea every day.The barely treated wastewater - which is brought to the surface during oil and gas drilling - contains high levels of toxins, oil and grease.The documents, which were issued by the Gulf of Suez Petroleum Company (Gupco) in 2019 to try to hire a company to treat the water, say the pollution levels ""do not comply"" with Egyptian environmental laws and regulations.Every day, 40,000 cubic metres of this toxic water - the equivalent of 16 Olympic-sized swimming pools - is going into the Red Sea, the documents say.Dr Greg Asner, an ecologist at Arizona State University, says the information is ""very alarming"", showing pollution from lead, cadmium, copper, nickel and other heavy metals. ""You don't have to be an expert to know that something is not right here,"" he says.The leaked documents indicate Egypt's government has known about the wastewater problem since at least 2019, after British oil company BP sold its 50% stake in the plant to United Arab Emirates' firm, Dragon Oil. The other 50% is owned by Egypt's state oil company.The sale by BP was part of a decision to dispose of company assets worth $10bn (Â£8bn at the time), seen by many commentators as a plan to help it meet climate targets.Caroline Lucas, a UK MP for the Green Party, says: ""It comes as no surprise that BP and others would rather sell on their dirtiest, most environmentally destructive assets, than clean them up themselves.""BP told the BBC the sale of its share of Gupco was for financial reasons, not as part of any plan to meet climate targets. It referred questions about the wastewater to Gupco.Gupco and Egypt's environment ministry did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.Access to the facilities at Ras Shukeir is restricted to oil workers and government inspectors. However, the BBC was able to use satellite images to examine the extent of the water pollution.Analysis of high-resolution satellite images shows a wide plume of green effluent flowing into the sea, travelling up to 20 km (12 miles) south into areas harbouring marine life.Satellite analysis company Soar.Earth used remote water quality monitoring techniques to examine the plume. The company's remote sensing expert, Sergio Volkmer, says it is ""not made of some algal bloom"" but from something beneath the surface, such as sediments or liquid emitted locally.That same green plume is visible in the earliest satellite image the BBC could find, from 1985, indicating that the oil terminal may have been dumping ""produced water"" into the Red Sea for decades. It still appears in the most recent image of the plant, from September 2022.Dr Asner, the Arizona State University ecologist, also examined the area using the Allen Coral Atlas, a high-resolution satellite tool that monitors coral reefs.He says while there are signs of a thriving ecosystem on either side of the impacted area, ""suddenly you can see it's hard to see through the water"" because of ""something on the surface which looks like pollution"".Dr Gera Troisi, a lecturer at Brunel University London who studies the effects of toxins on organisms, says compounds contained in ""produced water"" can react with sea water, absorb oxygen, and suffocate even the most resilient marine life.""We're suffocating them and then shielding them from the light because of all of these suspended solids,"" she says.The UN has warned that if global average temperatures rise by 1.5C, 90% of the world's coral will be wiped out. But despite sea temperatures rising faster in the Red Sea than the global average rate, the region's ""super coral"" has so far proved to be resilient to the effects of climate change.Some scientists believe Red Sea coral could hold the secret to saving coral around the world. One of them, oceanographer Sylvia Earle, says more research is needed to find out what makes this coral less vulnerable to rising temperatures.But she says it is of ""enormous importance to the international community because of the possibility of transplanting corals from the Red Sea to rehabilitate the degraded reefs in other parts of the world, like the Great Barrier Reef"". Despite covering only 0.1% of the oceans, coral reefs are home to 30% of marine biodiversity. In the Red Sea, they are a lifeline for endangered species such as hawksbill turtles, as well as supporting fishing, marine agriculture and tourism - which provide income for millions of Egyptians.Scientists, both in Egypt and internationally, have recommended the area where Gupco operates should be included in a new extended marine protection zone in the Red Sea, to cover the whole an area known as the Great Fringing Reef. Currently about 50% of the reef is in the zone. NGOs expected the extension to be announced by the environment ministry of Egypt at COP27. But so far no announcement has been made.Oil companies, Shell and Chevron, have carried out recent surveys for new oil and gas wells some 30 km away from protected parts of the Great Fringing Reef.The COP27 global climate summit in Egypt is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. More than 200 countries are attending the summit to discuss further measures to cut emissions and prepare for climate change, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.Climate stripes visualisation courtesy of Prof Ed Hawkins and University of Reading.","A climate-change resistant Red Sea reef is being flooded with toxic wastewater, leaked documents show.",https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63603861,/news/science_and_environment
35,Women largely absent from COP27 negotiations,"Too few women are participating in COP27 climate negotiations, charities, activists and politicians have warned.BBC analysis has found that women make up less than 34% of country negotiating teams at the UN summit in Egypt.This is despite evidence that females bear a disproportionate burden from climate change.Government officials and campaigners say that without greater representation climate change can't be tackled and women's lives will worsen as a result.Shirley Djukurna Krenak, an indigenous woman of the Krenak people of Minas Gerais, Brazil, told the BBC that women have always been ""fighters"" for the planet. She said that women understand ""what it means to live in community"", and therefore what it means to care for others and the natural world.Shirley told the BBC that indigenous women in particular have always fought for environmental protection and ""need to be respected and people need to listen to us"". Last week world leaders gathered at the COP27 summit and took the inaugural 'family photo'. There were 110 leaders present, but just 7 were women.This is one of the lowest concentrations of women seen at these UN climate summits - known as COPs, according to the Women's Environment and Development Organisation (WEDO), which tracks female participation at such events.The male skew among leaders reflected a broader trend across the delegation teams that countries have sent. Analysis by the BBC of the participant list found that less than 34% of country negotiation staff were female. Some teams were more than 90% male.These delegation teams participate in negotiations at the conference on key climate issues such as funding and limiting use of fossil fuels.In 2011 countries pledged to increase female participation at these talks, but the share this year has fallen since a peak of 40% in 2018, according to WEDO.Dr Jeanne d'Arc Mujawamariya, environment minister for Rwanda - which has 52% women in its cabinet - told the BBC the outcomes of the negotiations will be affected by the lack of women participating.This was a sentiment echoed by Rep. Kathy Castor, chair of the US Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. She told the BBC at COP27 that women's presence was vital. ""It is absolutely fundamental to climate action that we educate young women and girls, but that means they must have a seat at the table at international conferences,"" she said.On Monday, a new report by charity ActionAid revealed that women and girls are facing increased and specific risks as the climate crisis worsens. The report reveals that in many developing nations - which are facing the worst impacts of climate change - women have greater responsibility for securing water, food and fuel for their families, which can be more difficult during floods, drought or other climate-related crises. The majority of agricultural workers are also women, so when there is severe drought, as seen currently in East Africa, their income can be drastically cut. The UN has estimated that 80% of people displaced by climate change are women.Dr Sila Monthe is an International Rescue Committee health manager currently working in Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya. She told the BBC that she has seen increased nutrient deficiencies in women and young girls in the drought-affected area ""as they often eat last, and worst"". There are also concerns that as women go further afield to collect food and water they are exposed to increased risks of violence. Sophie Rigg, senior climate advisor at ActionAid, told the BBC that climate change is exacerbating gender inequalities and the solutions being discussed at COP27 must be tailored to the specific issues being faced by women. And young women are currently leading the charge on taking climate action, according to the UN. Some of the most famous legal cases brought against governments for inaction on climate change, have been brought by women. Global director for gender at the World Bank, Hana Brixi, said there is increasing evidence that having women participating improves the outcomes in global negotiations like COP27.Ms Rigg from ActionAid UK agrees: ""There is no getting around when women are in the room they create solutions that are proven to be more sustainable."" Because of this Ms Brixi said that she is seeing progress in female participation as organisations and governments wake up to the impact they can have.BBC analysis of the country teams at COP27 in Egypt shows that European, North American and island states are more likely to have balanced teams, whilst African and Middle Eastern countries are more likely to skew male.Ms Castor, from the US delegation, said that her country's negotiators have raised the issue of female participation with this years' hosts in Egypt and will be doing so with other countries.",Women barely feature in negotiations in Egypt despite bearing the brunt of climate change.,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63636435,/news/science_and_environment
36,UK virus research site left to deteriorate - MPs,"The UK's main facility for dealing with viruses that jump from animals to humans has been left to ""deteriorate to an alarming extent,"" according to MPs.The Public Affairs Committee report cited ""inadequate management and under-investment"" at the site in Weybridge.It said the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) had ""comprehensively failed in its historical management"" of the centre. Defra said work was already under way to upgrade the laboratories.The centre is operated by the government's Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). It is central to the UK's ability to control the outbreak of animal diseases and detect any emerging pathogens.The Public Accounts Committee found more than ""1,000 single points of failure"" at the Weybridge site. Its report said deterioration had left the laboratories ""continually vulnerable to a major breakdown"" which would severely impact the UK's ability to effectively respond to outbreaks. Some of the deadliest viruses on earth are ""zoonotic diseases"" that cross between species such as Covid-19, Sars or Ebola.The report said the risk to the UK of a zoonotic disease was ""real and the consequences can be devastating"", and accused the government of not sufficiently prioritising this threat to ""UK health, trade, farming and rural communities.""Committee chairwoman Dame Meg Hillier said: ""After the 2001 disaster of foot and mouth disease, the past decades have brought one animal-sourced disease after another. ""It is shocking that government has allowed UK capacity in this area to deteriorate so alarmingly over that same period,"" she said. ""These diseases are devastating for our food production systems, the economy and, when they jump the species barrier to humans as Covid-19 did, to our whole society.""The UK and EU are currently in the grip of a record avian flu outbreak that has killed 48 million birds.Prof Paul Wigley, professor of animal microbial ecosystems at the University of Bristol, warned that avian flu ""had the potential to jump to other species including us.""""Weybridge has always been a central resource of facilities and people. It has been placed in a perilous position by underfunding and crumbling facilities,"" he said. ""Without support it is increasingly unlikely the UK could cope with another major outbreak of animal or zoonotic disease along with the ongoing avian influenza epidemic.""The government has plans to redevelop the site, with the construction of a new science hub due to start in 2027. However the level of funding needed is still not finalised.Prof James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at University of Cambridge, said that the ""steady decline"" of the facility had been clear. ""We can no longer be reliant on laboratory resources from partner European laboratories. The significance of laboratories is demonstrated clearly by their central role in the diagnosis and control of the ongoing unprecedented avian influenza outbreak.""The current major Weybridge redevelopment programme is very welcome and important but it will take many years to be implemented and there are risks of laboratory failure occurring in the meantime.""A Defra spokesperson said: ""Significant funding and work is already underway to upgrade (Weybridge's) laboratories and ensure we are protected from these diseases into the future.""Its world-leading scientists and our field teams are playing a vital role in responding rapidly and decisively to the threats from animal diseases, including the current Avian Influenza outbreak, which is the largest on record.""

37,"No Greta, but young activists make waves at COP27","Young people are a more powerful force than ever in the UN climate summit, the UN's youngest climate advisor tells BBC News in Egypt.""Young people are definitely shaping outcomes here at COP27,"" Sophia Kianni says.Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg has skipped the Sharm el-Sheikh meeting, calling it a forum for ""greenwashing"".But young people from countries at high risk from climate change say they are ""calling it out"" from inside.In an address on Tuesday, climate activist Vanessa Nakate from Uganda will tell governments to wash their ""oil-stained"" hands.Speaking to G20 nations, she will tell ministers that they must end the ""moral and economic madness"" of funding fossil fuels and prioritising short-term politics.Activists from developing countries say they agree with Thunberg that COP is compromised by the large presence of oil and gas delegates.But they say their work has an impact here. Ayisha Siddiqa, 23, is from Pakistan, is one of the headline speakers at the Children and Youth Pavilion. It's the first time young people have had a dedicated space like this, where last week activists held a formal meeting with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.It's one of the most buzzing areas of COP27, with activists jostling to find space to sit and chat on the floor, and Ayisha tells me she's proud of the space.""This is for the youth, organized by us. Unlike government and business areas, there's no corporate branding everywhere,"" she says. She says questions about Greta miss the point about the reality of climate change. This summer, devastating floods killed 1,700 people in her home country Pakistan. ""The world has come to an end for peopleâ¦ For me, the stakes are so high that I can't just give up hope for change,"" she says. Kenyan Mana Omar, 27, worries the summit will not deliver the climate finance that her country needs - calling COP27 more like a ""trade fair"".But she still travelled here to represent her nomadic community severely affected by drought. ""My community are missing here, their voices are totally unheard, they live in areas with no internet. I just hope I can do my best to bring their message here,"" she explains. She says her role is to have ""hope where there is none"" and she wants a better future for her one-year-old daughter.But many activists, particularly from developing nations, say they faced significant barriers in coming to the summit in Egypt.Imran Hussein, from Bangladesh, lost his father in cyclone Aila in 2009 and says he is extremely worried about sea level rise in his costal home. He is at COP to get ""climate justice"" for his mother, who has worked in a garment factory since Imran's father died. Imran and his colleague Sohanur Rahmen explain they got grants for travel and hotels, but they cannot afford to eat at the conference.Delegates faced costs of about $4,000 a week for accommodation, as well as the costs of travel and visas.Activists say future climate summits must include special funds and accommodation for young people from civil society.But, waving their passes, Imran and Sohanur are proud they have been given spaces on Bangladesh's negotiating team.It gives them access to conversations behind-the-scenes where countries stake out their positions on the final agreements. Negotiations between countries on how to curb climate change will go on for the rest of the week, with reports suggesting a large gap remains between rich and poor nations.Youth activists are hopeful they will secure more money for communities devastated by climate change, and a firm commitment from leaders to radically phase out fossil fuels. But most admit they will probably have to come back next year.The COP27 global climate summit in Egypt is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. More than 200 countries are attending the summit to discuss further measures to cut emissions and prepare for climate change, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.Top image from Getty Images.

38,Fears 1.5C climate goal could be softened at COP27,"A key target to stop climate change raising global temperatures is under threat at a UN summit.Climate change talks have been trying to limit the average rise in temperatures to 1.5C.But at talks in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheik, there are concerns that target will slip.Senior figures here in Egypt are worried about backsliding on efforts to keep the 1.5C goal. There is a sense the Egyptian presidency is struggling to find common ground between rich and poor, and some delegates fear the focus on 1.5C may be softened to find agreement.The limit is important because climate scientists say temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100.Ministers and their negotiators face an intensive week of talks in Sharm El-Sheikh as pressure grows to conclude this meeting with a strong political message. According to the UN's climate chief, not enough progress has been made so far.""My observations are that there are too many unresolved issues,"" Simon Stiell said to the meeting over the weekend.""If we create a log-jam in the process, we will not deliver an outcome that is deserving of the crisis.""An analysis on the state of the negotiations by the Carbon Brief website shows widespread disagreement between parties.One of the big concerns though is that as the organisers struggle to find a way forward, a clear statement on the commitment to 1.5C figure might be fudged. In last year's Glasgow climate pact, all countries agreed to ""keep 1.5C alive"" by undertaking ""rapid, deep and sustained"" cuts in greenhouse gases.But at a G20 meeting in Indonesia in August, ministers were unable to agree a communique on climate change, as China and India were reported to have questioned the scientific feasibility of the 1.5C threshold.Such are the differences between countries here, there are fears that the final document being drafted by the Egyptians may dilute or exclude the 1.5C goal. ""I have been worried that there seems to some kind of attempt to say maybe 1.5C is not achievable any more,"" the former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, told the Irish Times on the sidelines of this summit. ""That is not acceptable,"" she said.Mrs Robinson, who is chair of the Elders group of former political leaders, has released a statement with around 200 of the world's largest businesses and civil society groups urging governments to align their national targets with 1.5C. Other senior figures were also clear that whatever the difficulties in the negotiations, 1.5C must remain at the heart of the message.""The cover text must make sure countries are fully committed to the 1.5C target,"" said Laurence Tubiana, one of the architects of the Paris climate agreement and head of the European Climate Foundation.""The world is witnessing the impact of the EU fossil fuels addiction, it should not repeat the same mistakes,"" she said.Concerns over 1.5C have also prompted an unusually strong statement from the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group within the talks. Representing the 46 countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of rising temperatures, they are resolutely opposed to any watering down of this key commitment. ""COP27 must send a strong political signal and show that the world is united on fighting climate change,"" said Madeleine Diouf Sarr, from Senegal, the chair of the LDC.""This means that at COP27, the 1.5C goal must remain within reach by having strong commitments to halving emissions by 2030.""There are many other outstanding issues to be covered by ministers and their officials over the next few days including money to help countries adapt to rising temperatures. Progress on the challenging issue of loss and damage will also be key as to whether COP27 is a success or failure. Developing countries are pleased that this issue of cash to cope with the immediate impacts of warming is at least being discussed, but the developed world is being criticised for dragging their heels on this hot button issue.There is also likely to be great excitement in the conference this week with the anticipated arrival of Brazil's newly elected president, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva. Negotiators will also be keeping a keen eye on events at the G20 meeting in Bali. A strong signal of commitment to climate change from leaders there may help overcome the divisions in evidence in Egypt.

39,Undercover in the world’s dirtiest oil field,"Far removed from the world leaders making climate pledges at COP, are people like Ali Hussein Julood, a young leukaemia survivor living on an Iraqi oil field co-managed by BP. When the BBC discovered BP was not declaring the field's gas flaring, Ali helped us to reveal the truth about the poisonous air the local community has to breathe.I first saw videos shared on Twitter of burning skies and clouds of black smoke over people's houses in Iraq's oil fields in 2019, and learned that this was a common procedure known as gas flaring - burning off the toxic excess gas that is a by-product of oil drilling. We discovered through satellite data that Rumaila in Basra, southern Iraq, is the world's worst offender for gas flaring. Gas flaring is not only a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, it is also known to emit benzene - which heightens the risk of cancer, particularly childhood leukaemia. Dozens of people we spoke to living in five different communities near oil fields like Rumaila, told the same story - that they had a close relative or a friend who was suffering from cancer, often leukaemia. One of those was Ali, then 18 years old, whose father had sold everything in his house to raise money for his son's cancer treatment in Turkey. Ali said that the cancer hospital in Basra was full of people like him who lived near oil fields. Rumaila, home to several thousand people, has been given the nickname ""the shadow town"" by locals, because it is cut off and lacking in basic services. Ali and his friends call it ""the cemetery"".""We'd be playing football, then we'd have to run inside, because of the clouds of smoke suffocating us and oil raining from the sky,"" Ali told us. ""When I told the doctor [in Basra Children's Cancer Hospital] I lived in this area he said: 'This is the main reason for your illness.'""But there had been no studies published on cancer rates in these communities. We later found out that data on this subject was being actively suppressed by the Iraqi government - a Basra health department document leaked to us revealed cancer rates were three times higher in Basra than official records claimed.People living and working in Rumaila sent us videos which gave us a glimpse of what life was like there, but we were struggling to be allowed in to film for ourselves. Our official requests were turned down on at least five occasions, and the oil field - which at 1,800 sq km is bigger than some small countries - is guarded by several checkpoints. Beyond those checkpoints, the area is patrolled by the Iraqi oil police and private security firms working for the oil companies. And behind all of this are the armed militia groups that dominate Iraqi politics in the south - and are profiting from the oil operations on their doorstep. So the only option remaining for us was to go into Rumaila undercover.Under Poisoned SkiesThe deadly impact of the oil giants' toxic air pollution on children and the planet is revealed in this BBC News Arabic investigation from the front line of climate change in Iraq.The documentary is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) and internationally on the BBC website.We wanted to film an experiment to monitor the pollution ourselves, which we had devised with leading global pollution experts. We practised before we went on the roof of BBC Broadcasting House in London. The experts had advised us to use what are known as diffusion tubes - small brass cylinders with a filter inside that absorbs pollutants. We worked with one of the region's only environmental scientists, Prof Shukri Al-Hassan, to carry out tests over a two-week period in communities neighbouring four different oil fields within 10km of the gas flaring, including Rumaila. We also took urine samples from children to see if there were detectable toxins linked to gas flaring exposure.Our test results indicated that all the 52 children we tested had high levels in their urine of metabolised naphthalene, a possible carcinogen. Our air pollution monitoring also found benzene levels to be three times higher than the national limit - and in all places it was much higher than the safe level, which the World Health Organization (WHO) says is zero. After the BBC's film was released, Iraq's Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar Ismail, pledged that all flaring from the Rumaila oil field would be eliminated by 2026. But he made the statement on his last day in office, and previous targets to eliminate flaring have been repeatedly missed. It is not clear with whom the accountability lies for phasing out flaring. The Iraqi government owns the oil field but BP manages it alongside their partner companies. The then oil minister Mr Abdul Jabbar Ismail told the BBC it was therefore BP's responsibility to reduce flaring. BP, however, says the obligation lies with the operator of the oil field - the Rumaila Operating Organisation [Roo] - which BP co-founded and in which it owns a 48% stake.And a number of whistleblowers from BP have approached us to tell us how bad they claim the situation is on the ground.One BP Rumaila ex-employee, Robert (not his real name), told us: ""As the lead contractor, BP's obligation [to the Iraqi government] was to implement best international practices in the operation and maintenance of Rumaila."" But, he went on to say, gas flaring ""is just the start"" of what he describes as ""appalling practices in Rumaila that would not be acceptable in any of BP's operations nor uphold the international standard that BP is contracted to implement"".He said that the failure to maintain and upgrade systems and infrastructure at the field caused systemic issues, leading to ""frequent oil spills, unplanned flaring and gas leaks"". This claim has been made by other BP employees too, and the BBC has seen video evidence of major oil leaks at Rumaila oil field.  Two other former BP employees have told us there is insufficient pollution monitoring carried out on site, making them feel worried about their safety.A spokesperson for BP said it ""would like to strongly refute the claims you raise with regards to operational safety at Rumaila. Since BP began working in Iraq along with our partners, significant improvements have been made. Following years of conflict and underinvestment, there is more to do; and we are fully committed to supporting further improvements at Rumaila, as a matter of urgency.""As for Ali, he is in remission from his leukaemia, but his immune system is still weak - his education was cut short and he can no longer play sport, having previously represented his school in regional football competitions. Many of the other children suffering from cancer who we met have since died - including 13-year-olds Fatima and Mustafa who lived near other oil fields in the area, and five-year-old Benin who lived in Rumaila, and who had already lost her older brother to the disease.Ali has repeatedly approached BP for compensation to pay for his missed education. He says an employee from Roo - its Rumaila operator - visited him a day after the BBC investigation was broadcast, and Ali again asked for compensation.""I told him how sick I got from the pollution and asked if BP could compensate me for the damage done to my health. But I have not heard from them since.""BP said it was not appropriate to comment on private conversations between Rumaila staff and individuals, but added that immediately after first being contacted by the BBC, ""BP started working with the Rumaila partners to look at the issues raised and, where necessary, how to address them. This includes a review of processes and procedures to support the community and understand any concerns - this is ongoing.""Ahead of our initial investigation, BP told us that ""in line with standard practice"" it reports flaring emissions from activities only where it is the operator - ""[Rumaila's] flaring and operational data are therefore not included in our reporting.""Insiders we spoke to estimated that improvements to reduce the flaring at Rumaila would cost in the range of $3-$5m (Â£2.6m-Â£4.4m) - a fraction of the Â£7bn ($8bn) quarterly record profit BP announced last week.

40,The big issues facing Egypt's COP27 climate summit,"World leaders are discussing action to tackle climate change at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt.It follows a year of climate-related disasters and broken temperature records.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is attending, having previously said he would not. United Nations (UN) climate summits are held every year, for governments to agree steps to limit global temperature rises. They are referred to as COPs, which stands for ""Conference of the Parties"". The parties are the attending countries that signed up to the original UN climate agreement in 1992. COP27 is the 27th annual UN meeting on climate. It is taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh until 18 November.The world is warming because of emissions produced by humans, mostly from burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal.Global temperatures have risen 1.1C and are heading towards 1.5C, according to the UN's climate scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).If temperatures rise 1.7 to 1.8C above 1850s levels, the IPCC estimates that half the word's population could be exposed to life-threatening heat and humidity.To prevent this, 194 countries signed the Paris Agreement in 2015, pledging to ""pursue efforts"" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C.More than 200 governments have been invited. In a speech on Monday Mr Sunak is set to urge world leaders at COP27 to move ""further and faster"" in transitioning to renewable energy. He will say Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""reinforced"" the importance of ending dependence on fossil fuels.Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also going, but King Charles will not be there, following government advice. However, he held a pre-conference reception at Buckingham Palace. Vladimir Putin is not due to go, although Russian delegates are still expected to take part. Other countries, including China, have not confirmed whether their leaders will attend.Hosts Egypt called on countries to put their differences aside and ""show leadership"" on the issue of climate change. Environmental charities, community groups, think tanks, businesses and faith groups will also take part.The conference is taking place in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.This will be the fifth time a COP has been hosted in Africa. The region's governments hope it will draw attention to the severe impacts of climate change on the continent. The IPCC says Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world. Currently, 20 million people are estimated to be facing food insecurity in east Africa because of drought. However, choosing Egypt as the venue has attracted controversy.Some human rights and climate campaigners say the government has stopped them attending because they have criticised its rights record.Ahead of the meeting, countries were asked to submit ambitious national climate plans. Only 25 have done so to date.COP27 will focus on three main areas:Some areas not fully resolved or covered at COP26 will be picked up:There will also be themed days on issues including gender, agriculture and biodiversity.Finance has been long been an issue at climate talks.In 2009, developed countries committed to give $100bn (Â£88bn) a year, by 2020, to developing countries to help them reduce emissions and prepare for climate change. The target was missed and moved back to 2023. But developing nations are also calling for payments for ""loss and damage"" - the impacts faced now. An option for making such payments was excluded from the Bonn climate talks, after pushback from wealthier nations who feared they would be forced to pay compensation for decades.But the EU agreed that discussions should take place at COP27.It depends who you ask.Following intense negotiations, the issue of loss and damage payments is on the official agenda of COP27. Developing countries will also be pushing to have a date set for when they might start to receive payments. Developed nations will be looking for more commitment from large developing countries - such as China, India, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa - to move away from coal, the dirtiest of the fossil fuels. There are also pledges from last year's meeting - on forests, coal, and methane - that more countries may support.However, some scientists believe world leaders have left it too late and no matter what is agreed at COP27, 1.5C will not be achieved.Climate activist Greta Thunberg is among the list of those who will not attend.She recently described the global summit as a forum for ""greenwashing"", saying the COP conferences ""encourage gradual progress"".Earlier in October she told the BBC's media editor Amol Rajan in an interview: ""I'm not needed there... there will be other people who will attend, from the most affected areas. And I think that their voice there is more important.""Top image from Reuters.

41,Can floating turbines harvest the world's wind?,"Ten miles off the coast of Aberdeen in Scotland, five turbines tower over the North Sea. Each is as tall as the giant towers of Canary Wharf in London's docklands.Kincardine is the world's largest floating wind farm.It helps solve an engineering riddle. And its designers believe it shows how offshore wind can become a truly global energy source.In much of the world, the seabed takes a sudden dive close offshore, ruling out the use of conventional offshore wind turbines.These are built up from the sea floor on concrete foundations and can only be deployed in relatively shallow water, up to about 60m.The solution sounds obvious - installing turbines on floating platforms - but imagine for a moment the fearsome forces these structures must withstand. The turbines at the Kincardine wind farm must stand tall in the heaviest swells and fiercest storms the tempestuous North Sea brings their way.The success of the technology draws on Britain's expertise in offshore engineering, honed as it developed the oil and gas resources in the North Sea. Each tower sits atop three huge cylindrical floats. They are painted bright yellow and welded into a triangular platform each side of which is 67m long.This is not a passive structure, explains Greg Campbell-Smith, of Principle Power, the UK company that developed the platform technology. The floats need to adapt to changes in the wind and sea conditions. In strong winds the tower ""heels"" or leans away from the wind, says Mr Campbell-Smith.A network of pumps and valves shift liquid ballast between the three floating cylinders to rebalance the platform and set the turbine at the ideal angle for the wind.Below the surface, weighted subsea cables attached to huge anchors make sure the platform is firmly secured to the seabed.Principle Power claims the Kincardine facility proves the potential of floating wind.It says it produces enough electricity each year to power 35,000 British homes.But it faces stiff competition. Companies around the world are producing their own designs for floating wind platforms.Last month the US government offered $50m of new funding to encourage American companies to install 15GW of floating wind in US waters by 2035.The aim is to drive down costs by 75% and ""help the US lead on offshore wind"", according to the White House.There is certainly a huge potential market.The UK's independent climate advisors, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), says that about half of the 100GW of offshore wind it expects will have been installed by 2050 will be on floating platforms.The technology could deliver Â£43bn of economic activity, employing up to 29,000 people, according to estimates by the UK offshore wind industry association RenewableUK.And the global prospects are even more promising. Some two-thirds of the US potential for offshore wind is reckoned to be in deep water, 80% of the European seabed is all only accessible using floating technology and much of the sea off Japan is also deep.The total worldwide pipeline of floating wind projects has doubled in the last year alone and now totals to180GW, suggests RenewableUK.Floating wind is set to be a Â£400-5000bn global market by 2050, calculates the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult, a UK research centre for offshore wind technology.The big challenge now is cost. This new technology is expensive. Kilowatt hour for kilowatt hour, floating wind comes in at about the same price as new nuclear power.But, unlike nuclear power, the expectation is that costs will tumble as the market grows.Solar panel prices have fallen by 90% since 2010 as the technology has been rolled out at scale. Conventional offshore wind has also seen dramatic cost reductions.But the industry warns that investment will be needed to deliver on the promise this new technology holds.It requires deep ports with huge workspaces to allow the manufacturing and assembling of the vast floating structures.Oil and gas platforms tend to come as one-off orders, but floating wind platforms will need to be constructed on a ""production line"". The biggest floating wind farms will consist of 100 or more platforms.The UK government has promised Â£160m to beef up the country's port infrastructure but RenewableUK believes more investment will be needed.And although Britain is the first country to successfully deploy floating wind at scale, there are limits to its ability to harvest the rewards of its efforts.Boris Johnson famously wanted the UK to become the ""Saudi Arabia of wind"" - owning most of its energy industry - but his boast always rang hollow.Most of the UK's turbines are built by British workers but in factories and on wind farms owned and operated by foreign firms.Nevertheless, the industry is adamant that floating wind represents a huge opportunity for the UK.""Everything that is happening here in the subsurface world is something the UK can really be masters at,"" says Dan McGrail the CEO of Renewable UK.""It is incredibly exciting because it signifies the opening up of offshore wind to the entire globe,"" he says.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63300959,/news/science_and_environment
42,Can an enormous seaweed farm help curb climate change?,"Imagine a huge seaweed farm the size of Croatia floating in the South Atlantic between Africa and South America. Spinning in a natural ocean eddy, it sucks a billion tonnes of carbon out of the atmosphere every year and sinks it to the ocean floor out of harm's way. Far-fetched? Maybe. But a British businessman plans to have this up and running by 2026. Scientists say reducing the world's emissions probably won't be enough and that carbon capture will be crucial to limiting global warming. Butâ¯carbon capture schemes have so far been relatively low-scale and seen limited success. If they are going to work, they need to be bold, big, and attractive to investors. Businessman John Auckland believes he has just such an idea. He wants to exploit what he calls ""the wondrous properties"" of the floating seaweed sargassum. He's confident his Seafields floating farm will draw sufficient CO2 from the air to moderate the effects of climate change, while also earning its backers carbon credits. At 55,000 sq km (21,200 sq miles) Auckland is thinking big.  It needs to be vast to put a dent in the fifty gigatonnes of carbon dioxide we pump into the atmosphere every year. A gigatonne is a billion tonnes: the amount of carbon Auckland's mega-farm aims to capture annually. The project is currently road-testing its technology in the Caribbean and Mexico, and is inspired by the ideas of Prof Victor Smetacek, a marine biologist. Described by Seafields as their Scientific Founder, he has long been fascinated by the potential to grow seaweed in enormous rotating ocean currents known as gyres.   ""They collect all kinds of stuff in the middle,"" he says. ""The best known examples, of course, are the plastic garbage that is accumulating in the middle of the subtropical gyres.""  In the same way these giant eddies trap islands of floating plastics, Seafields plans to hem in its crop of sargassum.  ""The gyre just stops the sargassum from escaping,"" explains John Auckland. ""As long as we create the right conditions for it, it will only grow there. If any escapes from our farm, it will just die off or just fail to continue growing."" He had better be right. Sargassum has plagued the Caribbean's tourism industry for decades. When it washes up on the coast, its rot gives off a foul stench. Not the best setting for relaxing on a beach towel.  But Seafields is confident this will not happen with their seaweed. It says any that escapes from the farm should be starved the nutrients the team plans to syphon up from the ocean depths to feed their crop.  Because of evaporation from the subtropical sun beating down on it all day, the surface water trapped in gyres is very salty and low in nutrients. It is why Prof Smetacek calls gyres ""the oceans' deserts"".  Yet, as these deserts slowly turn, they glide over a colder, nutrient rich ocean layer that the professor wants to draw to the surface to sustain the sargassum.  ""If you were to connect the nutrient rich, deep water with pipes,"" explains Prof Smetacek, ""bring that water up from the bottom and let it warm up, then it will flow up by itself and continue flowing forever."" The team is testing their technology in early 2023. It will be a nail-biter. While first theorised back in 1956, the salt fountain has successfully been recreated, but nowhere near the enormous scale Seafields plans. If the salt fountain does work to scale, Prof Smetacek predicts a bumper crop of sargassum.  ""They have enormous growth rates. They double their biomass every 10 days,"" he says. ""The good thing about seaweed is that you can harvest it with a combine harvester."" Prof Smetacek envisages floating harvesters will bale the crop up and then send it down to the inert depths of the sea floor, where there is so little oxygen the bales will not rot. The carbon they contain will remain fixed in the seaweed's structure. Tests are ongoing, but the team envisages they can sequester captured carbon for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years.  Seafields' financial backers hope sargassum will float money their way too. They plan to sell credits for captured carbon on the world's carbon markets. These credits allow businesses like airlines that cannot easily cut their emissions, to buy up carbon reductions made elsewhere. Carbon market critics complain the onward rush to monetise CO2 capture has led to backers overselling technologies that eventually fall short of their stated aims. Which begs the question: will Seafields' promising plan in the laboratory actually work when released into the wild?  Dr Nem Vaughan, associate professor in climate change at the University of East Anglia says: ""I'm a boring scientist, [I'd want] more data, more research, before I'd wholeheartedly say that you're going to get that kind of gigatonne-scale removal happening.""  Dr Vaughan is also worried about a scheme that itself could have profound impacts on biological systems. Can Seafields contain so much potentially damaging seaweed out in the South Atlantic? Is the salt fountain robust enough to weather all conditions? ""People wouldn't be very happy,"" she says, ""if tonnes of plastic tubes got set adrift by a big Atlantic storm like we've just had"". She says there are less technologically challenging ways of giving nature a nudge, such as growing more trees and hedgerows and protecting habitats such as peatlands that naturally hold carbon. But, first and foremost, she says: ""We need to not stick it [CO2] up there. Just leave the fossil fuels in the ground, team. It's an awful lot easier to just leave it in the ground than it is to try and capture it once it's out."" John Auckland concedes some elements of the process aren't yet proven, but believes it's worth the gamble.""I see far more risky things on a daily basis that investors are willing to put their money into,"" he says.  ""We can actually make significant gains in solving the climate crisis. You can't not take this risk, because if everyone thought that way, no-one would be working on solutions of this scale.""

43,Greenland's future may be written under North Sea,"There are clues to the near-future behaviour of a warming Greenland, and perhaps even a warming Antarctic, buried under the North Sea.Look below its bottom muds and you will find immense valleys. Hundreds of them.They were carved by rivers of meltwater running beneath the ice sheet that covered Northern Europe towards the end of Earth's last major cold phase.We've known about these valleys (often called ""tunnel valleys"" because they were incised under the ice sheet) for some time, but only in recent years has their true scale become apparent.Modern seismic (sound wave) data gathered by oil and gas prospectors has brought a new clarity that has enabled scientists to study the hidden features in greater detail.In places, the channels are more like canyons - up to 150km long, 6km wide and 500m deep.The new advance is in describing the erosional processes involved in cutting the valleys, the speed at which that happened, and the amount of water that could be drained by them.We're talking discharges of 900 cubic metres per second in the largest channels. To put that in context, English rivers such as the Thames, the Severn and the Trent might only get above 100 cu m/s in flood conditions.Researchers from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) worked with a team led from the University of Sheffield to decipher the valleys' development as the northern ice sheet advanced and then retreated, between about 27,000 and 19,000 years ago.The Sheffield team has spent a decade working out the precise extent of the ice in a remarkable project called Britice-Chrono.The BAS team was able to use this information, along with the high-resolution seismic imagery, to model how the channels evolved.""We started seeing these smaller channels at the base of the very large tunnel valleys, which seemed to meander and migrate over time,"" explained BAS PhD student James Kirkham.""We worked out, basically, that when you force all that water through these smaller channels, they can be extremely erosive. You end up forming the larger channels over just a few hundreds of years. This is really, really rapid on ice sheet timescales.""  Streaming large volumes of water under an ice sheet can have implications for its stability. If the water is spread out, it can lubricate the flow, potentially aiding the sheet's collapse - with everything that means for sea-level rise.On the other hand, if that water can be expelled rapidly in discreet channels, it might allow the ice sheet to sit down more firmly on the rock bed, to steady it.These are the scenarios now being considered for the future of the Greenland Ice Sheet.Already, it experiences wide-scale surface melt in Summer.Water collects in numerous top-side ponds before then draining to the bed and escaping under the ice to the ocean.If, in the coming decades, similar valleys are cut under Greenland as were incised under Northern Europe's ancient ice sheet, how will that play into the future stability of Greenland?""There's some debate about whether these rapidly forming channels will accelerate or stabilise ice retreat in a warming world. What we do know, though, is that right now, these processes are not being incorporated at all into our ice sheet models,"" said BAS geophysicist Dr Kelly Hogan.""We're looking here at a snapshot of what could happen in Greenland as it gets hotter and hotter. Will the ice go much faster, or slow down? We need to put what we've learnt in the North Sea into the models to see what it does to the ice dynamics.""Circumstances in Antarctica, Earth's biggest ice sheet, are somewhat different to those in Greenland. Certainly, for the short to medium term.Ice losses in the polar south are driven largely by incursions of warm ocean waters at the ice sheet's margins. Warmer air causing melting and ponding at the surface, like we see in Greenland, is evident in a few places but is less of a factor. This could change, of course, if temperatures continue to rise globally. Kirkham, Hogan and others have published their investigations of the North Sea's tunnel valleys in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63147947,/news/science_and_environment
44,Revealed: Huge gas flaring emissions never reported,"Major oil companies are not declaring a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, a BBC News investigation has revealed.The BBC found millions of tonnes of undeclared emissions from gas flaring at oil fields where BP, Eni, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell work.Flaring of natural gas is the ""wasteful"" burning of excess gas released during oil production.The companies said their reporting method was standard industry practice.Flared gases emit a potent mix of carbon dioxide, methane and black soot which pollute the air and accelerate global warming.The BBC has also found high levels of potentially cancer-causing chemicals in Iraqi communities near oil fields where there is gas flaring. These fields have some of the highest levels of undeclared flaring in the world, according to our findings. In response, David Boyd, UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, compared these communities to ""modern sacrifice zones, areas where profit and private interests are prioritised over human health, human rights and the environment"".Under Poisoned SkiesThe deadly impact of the oil giants' toxic air pollution on children and the planet is revealed in this BBC News Arabic investigation from the front line of climate change in Iraq.The documentary is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) and is also being broadcast on BBC World News at 08:10 GMT on Saturday 1 October.Companies have long recognised the need to eliminate all but emergency flaring.BP, Eni, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell are committed to a 2015 World Bank pledge to declare and end routine flaring by 2030 - in Shell's case by 2025.But the companies say that where they have contracted with another company to run day-to-day operations, it is that other firm's responsibility to declare flaring emissions. Such fields are a major part of oil production - accounting for 50% of these five companies' portfolios, on average.However, through months of analysis the BBC found dozens of oil fields where these operators are not declaring the emissions either, meaning no-one is.Using World Bank flare-tracking satellite data, we were able to identify the emissions from each of these sites. We estimate that in 2021, almost 20 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent went unreported from these flares. That is equal to the greenhouse gas emissions 4.4 million cars would produce in a year.In response, all five firms said that the approach to reporting emissions only from the sites they directly operate was standard industry practice. Shell and Eni additionally said that they do give an overall emissions figure which includes flaring from non-operated sites, but said this is not broken down or included in their World Bank pledge to cut emissions.  A BBC News Arabic investigation indicates that flaring increases the risk of some cancers for people living near oil fields in Iraq.People living in some of the world's biggest oil fields in Basra, south-east Iraq - Rumaila, West Qurna, Zubair and Nahran Omar - have long suspected that childhood leukaemia is on the increase, and that flaring is behind it. In the Basra region, new cases of all types of cancer rose by 20% between 2015 and 2018, according to a leaked Iraq Health Ministry report seen by BBC News Arabic. It blames air pollution. BP and Eni are the lead contractors at Rumaila and Zubair oil fields respectively, but as they are not the operators they do not declare the emissions. Neither do the sites' operators. BBC News Arabic worked with environment and health experts near the four sites in 2021 to test for cancer-causing chemicals associated with flaring over two weeks.  The air tests indicated levels of benzene, linked to leukaemia and other blood disorders, reached or exceeded Iraq's national limit in at least four places. Urine samples we collected from 52 children indicated that 70% had elevated levels of 2-Naphthol, a form of the possibly cancer-causing substance naphthalene. Dr Manuela Orjuela-Grimm, professor of childhood cancer at Columbia University, said: ""The children have strikingly high levels â¦ this is concerning for [their] health and suggests they should be monitored closely."" When she was 11, Fatima Falah Najem was diagnosed with a type of blood and bone cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Exposure to benzene can increase the risk of people developing this condition. Fatima lived with her parents and six siblings near Zubair oil field, where Eni is the lead contractor. Neither Eni nor Zubair's operating company declare flaring emissions there. For health reasons, Iraqi law prohibits flaring within six miles (10 km) of people's homes. But the flares in Zubair blaze almost continuously, just 1.6 miles from the family's front door. Fatima drew the ""fiery flames"" that surrounded her home, during her chemotherapy treatment. She told us she enjoyed watching them at night, and came to normalise them.But for her father, watching her get sick was ""like being on fire without being able to extinguish it"".Fatima died last November as her family desperately sought a bone marrow transplant. She was 13.Asked for a response, Eni said it ""strongly rejects any allegation that its own activities are endangering the health of the Iraqi people"". Eni said that it does not contractually have responsibility for flaring in Zubair.Rumaila oil field, 25 miles away, flares more gas than any other site in the world, according to BBC calculations - enough to power nearly three million UK homes a year.BP is the lead contractor - it helped establish and now supervises the operator, Rumaila Operating Organisation (ROO). Neither declares any flaring from the oil field. ROO's operating standards, which BP signed, say: ""Those who are impacted by pollution levels that exceed national limits are legally entitled to compensation."" But Ali Hussein Julood, a 19-year-old leukaemia survivor, says that he and his father were met with silence when they sought compensation from BP in 2020 and 2021.BP said: ""We are extremely concerned by the issues raised by the BBC - we will immediately review those concerns."" On the leaked report on cancer in the Basra area, Iraq's Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar Ismail told us: ""We instructed all the contracted companies operating in the oil fields to uphold international standards."" If all the natural gas flared globally were captured and used it could replace more than nine-tenths of Europe's gas imports from Russia, based on figures from the International Energy Agency.Capturing the gas can be initially expensive and technically difficult, according to the World Bank. It estimates that ending all routine flaring could cost as much as $100bn (Â£92bn).But Mark Davis, chief executive of Capterio, which advises oil companies on capturing flared gas, told the BBC that countries like Norway have shown it is possible with the help of strong regulation.

45,Life on Mars? Australian rocks may hold clues,"Rocks in the Australian Outback dating back 3.5 billion years may help scientists work out whether there has ever been life on Mars. Researchers studying the Australian rocks say only ancient microbes could have shaped them the way they are.Nasa's Perseverance rover should look for similarities when exploring rocks of a similar age on Mars, they say.The wheeled robot is searching for evidence that biology took hold on the Red Planet early in its history.Scientists from London's Natural History Museum working with Nasa have described a range of features, both large and small, in a series of domes in western Australia that appear inarguably to have been made by ancient microbes.Perseverance is exploring a large crater called Jezero and is expected to come across locations next year that may well display phenomena tantalisingly similar to what is seen in the Earth rocks.These are preserved examples of what are called stromatolites.     They are created when many millimetre-scale layers of bacteria and sediment build up over time into larger, dome-like forms. These edifices occur today at the edge of calm, nutrient-rich lagoons. But there are examples from billions of years ago preserved in the Australian Outback.Indeed, some of the Aussie specimens identified by geologists represent among the earliest traces of life on our planet.Dr Keyron Hickman-Lewis, from London's Natural History Museum (NHM), and colleagues, looked in detail at one particular set of stromatolites. They're the oldest yet discovered, part of the Dresser Formation in the Pilbara region of the Outback and are dated to 3.48 billion years ago.They don't contain little fossils of microbes, or even any organic (carbon-rich) compounds that might be indicative of past life. But the NHM-led team thinks it has managed to establish signatures that mark out the rocks' biological origin. The researchers used a range of high-resolution analytical and imaging techniques to detail structures whose existence, they argue, can only really be explained by life's activity, as opposed to something that might result naturally in the environment.One large-scale feature is the undulating top surface of the stromatolites, which arises as photosynthetic microbes grow towards the light. The undulations emerge because biology doesn't grow at the same rate in the same way in three dimensions.On the micro-scale, there are tiny columns or pillars within the rock that trace the connections between the individual ""mats"" of microbes that build the stromatolites.""These are strongly, strongly representative of a kind of microbial growth texture, which we call palisade structures,"" Dr Hickman-Lewis explained. ""We know palisade structures abundantly from environments on the modern Earth; we can see examples that are of a similar size and of a similar arrangement. And these occur very much in these domed growth layers,"" he told BBC News.The relevance here to Mars and the Perseverance rover is that Jezero Crater looks from satellite imagery to have held a large lake deep in its past. And at the edge of the crater are carbonate rocks that could represent the sediments laid down at the shoreline. Might Jezero have had microbes growing stromatolites in the crater's calm, nutrient-rich, shallow waters?The timeline would not be dissimilar to Earth, just a little earlier. Scientists think the lake existed about 3.7 billion years ago.Perseverance will probably get to the crater edge towards the end of next year. At that point, it will be deploying its instruments to try to locate rocks that share some of the characteristics seen in the Pilbara stromatolites.Prof Caroline Smith is head of the Earth science collections at the NHM and, like Dr Hickman-Lewis, is working on the rover mission.She said they would be using what they've learnt from Australia to steer some of the rover's investigations, looking for those tell-tale biological signatures.     ""We could identify some of them using the imaging systems on the rover, but it will depend - first, obviously, on whether stromatolites were even there, and then how well preserved they might be. ""Are they preserved more on a macro or micro scale? Are they ubiquitous, or maybe they are going to be limited in a smaller area. So if we're looking in the wrong place, then we won't necessarily see them,"" she cautioned.A slam dunk identification of ancient biology in Jezero Crater is a very long shot. More likely would be the discovery of rock samples that represent excellent candidates for further study back on Earth. This is the primary objective of Perseverance - to drill and store samples that can be collected by later missions and brought home for analysis.Proving life existed will be difficult, but Dr Hickman-Lewis believes his team's study has developed a template to do it: ""If an archaeologist discovered the foundations of a ruined city, they would nonetheless know it was built by people because it would bear all the hallmarks of being built by people - doorways and roads and bricks. In very much the same way, there are numerous structural elements integral to stromatolites that allow us to identify their processes of formation and decode their origins."" The analysis of Earth's oldest stromatolites is published in the journal Geology.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63589825,/news/science_and_environment
46,Satellites readied for first UK orbital launch,"They may look like nondescript grey boxes, but they are about to make history.Inside these containers are the nine satellites that will become the first-ever payloads to launch to orbit from the UK.They will go up on a rocket operated by British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit company.The mission, likely to occur sometime in the next few weeks, will be initiated from Cornwall.It will see a repurposed Virgin Atlantic jumbo carry the rocket and its passengers out over the Atlantic to a designated launch zone just south of Ireland.At the appropriate moment, at an altitude of 35,000ft, the 747 will release the rocket, which will then ignite its engine to begin the climb high into the sky.The event is being billed as a big one for the UK space sector. Internationally renowned for making satellites of all sizes, the country's space industry has always had to send its products to foreign spaceports to get them into orbit.Adding a launch capability means the sector will in future be able to do everything from first design through to mission operations.This means cost and time savings for British firms but the hope is the final piece of the jigsaw will also make the UK a more attractive place for other nation's companies to come and invest.The first Cornwall launch will support a range of applications, both civil and defence.A number of those nine satellites will be gathering intelligence, such as listening across radio transmissions coming from ships. One payload that has attracted particular attention is Wales's first-ever satellite.Produced by Cardiff start-up Space Forge, it will demonstrate key components for future mini orbital factories. The company envisions making high-value, high-fidelity materials in the weightless environment of space before bringing them back down to Earth.All the satellites are what are termed cubesats. They are not much bigger than a toaster. Miniaturisation of electronics enables engineers now to cram a lot of performance into very small volumes.The satellites are held at the top of the rocket in dispensers. These are the boxes you see in the image at the head of this page.When the Virgin rocket reaches the correct altitude, doors will open on the dispensers and springs will gently eject the spacecraft.Exactly when the mission will occur is a little uncertain just now.Both Spaceport Cornwall (Newquay Airport) and Virgin Orbit are waiting on licences that have yet to be issued by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).The CAA estimated at the beginning of the year that it would take six to 12 months to process a licence application from a spaceport, and nine to 18 months from a rocket operator.Last week, the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee issued a report in which it said the time being taken to issue the licences was ""disappointing"", given that everyone had been led to believe a launch was likely in September.The CAA will not comment on individual licences but emphasises the detail and seriousness that goes into producing the many thousands of pages that support an application.The authority is using what it believes is a streamlined process, what it calls an ""outcomes-focused regime"". This means setting the broad standards that are expected in terms of design and safety, for example, but leaving it up to the licensee as to how they meet those requirements. The CAA has said that in time it will move to multiple-launch licences, allowing operators to run many missions on the one approval.

47,Nasa space probes document big impacts on Mars,"Space probes have witnessed a big impact crater being formed on Mars - the largest in the Solar System ever caught in the act of excavation. A van-sized object dug out a 150m-wide bowl on the Red Planet, hurling debris up to 35km (19 miles) away.In more familiar terms, that's a crater roughly one-and-a-half times the size of London's Trafalgar Square. And its blast zone would fit neatly in the area inside the UK capital's orbital motorway, the M25.Scientists detected the event using the seismometer on the US space agency's InSight lander. The probe picked up the ground vibrations.Confirmation came from follow-up imagery acquired by Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). This satellite routinely pictures the planet and could produce the before-and-after proof of a major surface disturbance, corresponding to the exact timing and in the expected direction and distance (3,500km) from InSight.""This is the biggest new crater we've ever seen,"" said Dr Ingrid Daubar from Brown University. ""It's about 500ft wide, or about two city blocks across, and even though meteorites are hitting the planet all the time, this crater is more than 10 times larger than the typical new craters we see forming on Mars. ""We thought a crater this size might form somewhere on the planet once every few decades, maybe once a generation, so it was very exciting to be able to witness this event.""The post-impact observation shows huge chunks of buried water-ice have been excavated and thrown around the edges of the crater. Buried water-ice has never before been seen so close to Mars' equator. Such deposits would be an important resource for future human missions to the planet. ""That ice can be converted into water, oxygen or hydrogen. That could be really useful,"" said Dr Lori Glaze, Nasa's director of planetary science. Using its French/UK-built seismometer instrument, Nasa's Insight lander has detected more than 1,300 quakes on Mars since its arrival in November 2018. But the Magnitude 4 tremor resulting from this particular event, which occurred on 24 December, 2021, immediately piqued the interest of mission scientists because it contained a component of so-called ""surface waves"".The vast majority of quakes picked up by InSight have produced the traditional primary and secondary waves associated with rock movements deep within the planet.  These newly detected ripples were travelling in the uppermost portion of Mars, through its crust.""This is the first-time seismic surface waves have been observed on a planet other than Earth. Not even the Apollo missions to the Moon managed it,"" said Doyeon Kim from ETH Zurich's Institute of Geophysics and a lead author on the scholarly reports appearing in Science Magazine this week.The recognition of surface waves also enabled the researchers to identify a second meteorite strike. This one, on 18 September, 2021, occurred roughly 7,500km from InSight. It was a slightly smaller event and produced a cluster of craters, the largest of which was 130m in diameter.Scientists think both impacts can provide fresh knowledge about Mars' interior. Whereas the deeply sourced quakes tell them about the structure and composition of the planet's mantle and core, the surface waves reveal new details about the overlying crust.Researchers can tell that in between the InSight lander and the impact sites, the crust has a very uniform structure and high density. This contrasts with the previously reported three layers of low-density crust directly below InSight.This realisation may have something to say, too, about the famous Mars dichotomy - the observation that the Northern Hemisphere is low and relatively flat, whereas the Southern Hemisphere of the planet is high and mountainous.Researchers have wondered whether that's because the crust in these regions is composed of different materials. But the new surface wave data and its suggestion of widespread uniformity in the crust would imply this theory is probably not the best explanation. Dr Ben Fernando from Oxford University is an InSight mission scientist. ""InSight's observations in the transition zone between the North and the South have been really valuable because clearly the crust evolved in very different ways in those regions of the planet,"" he told BBC News. ""How and why they developed the way they did is still an open question, but I think these impact events have probably provided more understanding on this topic than anything else we've done so far on the mission.""There are many craters on Mars, the consequence of billions of years of bombardment from rocks drifting through space. Some are true giants. The Hellas Basin is an impact structure over 2,000km in diameter.But the 2021 impacts are significant because scientists have the instrument data recording the moment of their creation.""Something like [the 24 December impactor] hits Earth a few times every decade, but burns up safely in the atmosphere or drops a few meteorites. We were amazingly lucky to catch this one while InSight was listening,"" commented Prof Gareth Collins from Imperial College London.The InSight mission is close to ending. Dust is settling on its solar panels, reducing their efficiency.""In the next short amount of time, perhaps somewhere between four and eight weeks as best we can can predict, we expect the lander to not have enough power to operate any longer,"" the mission's principal investigator Dr Bruce Banerdt told reporters.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63418056,/news/science_and_environment
48,Webb telescope's ghostly 'Pillars of Creation',"Why satisfy yourself with one course when you can have a double helping?The US space agency Nasa has issued a second image of the famous ""Pillars of Creation"" taken by the new super space telescope, James Webb.This week we get a rendering of the active star-forming region as seen by Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI).Last week, it was the observatory's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) that was highlighting this remarkable location some 6,500 light-years from Earth.The pillars lie at the heart of what astronomers refer to as Messier 16 (M16), or the Eagle Nebula. They are the subject of intense study. Every great telescope is pointed in their direction to try to understand the physics and the chemistry in play as new stars are birthed in great clouds of gas and dust.Webb, with its 6.5m-wide mirror and high-fidelity sensors, is the latest, biggest and best space observatory to take in the scene.What's interesting about the new MIRI picture is the choice of wavelengths used to display the pillars.Ordinarily, astronomers might filter the light to make the dusty columns go very largely translucent, so that their interior, nascent stars can be seen in greater detail. This is what the NIRCam image did: it emphasised the thousands of young blue stars that are present.And MIRI is capable of taking this approach on another step. But on this occasion, the filtering has selected those wavelengths at which the dust itself actually glows.""Defying expectations that mid-infrared observations let you see through dust, this stunning image shows that they're also great for studying dust and complex molecules made to glow by the intense light of nearby hot stars,"" explained Prof Mark McCaughrean, the senior advisor for science at the European Space Agency.Some of the complex chemistry this helps accentuate involves polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs. These are very carbon-rich compounds. You find them on burnt toast and in the exhaust from motor vehicles. PAHs produced by stars are thought to enrich the carbon content throughout the Universe.MIRI was developed in a collaborative effort between scientists and engineers from 10 European countries, led by the UK, and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Its co-principal investigator is Prof Gillian Wright.""It's simply thrilling to see how well MIRI is performing. It's producing radically new science information - stuff we've never had before,"" the director of the UK Astronomy Technology Centre told BBC News.""What we see in this new image is akin to the 'skin' of the pillars, if you like. You can see filamentary structures which are where the stars are starting to burn through the dust. And you can see regions that are dark - they're so dense and cold that they're not even lighting up for MIRI.""James Webb is a collaborative project of the US, European and Canadian space agencies. It was launched in December last year and is regarded as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63431578,/news/science_and_environment
49,Europe's delayed Mars rover to get rescue package,"Europe's research ministers are to be asked for ""up to â¬360m"" (Â£313.5m) to start the process of reconfiguring the Rosalind Franklin Mars rover mission.The UK-built robot missed its window to go to the Red Planet this year when the West suspended all scientific co-operation with Russia.Engineers are now having to redesign the project to include only European and American components.This shift in emphasis means the robot will not now launch until 2028.A long cruise through space would result in a 2030 landing.Eight years is a long time to wait, but European Space Agency (Esa) officials are convinced the scientific imperative behind the mission will still be compelling at the end of the decade.""The point is there is no other mission that is foreseen or planned to actually go to a location on Mars that is four billion years old, and drill below the surface to look for prebiotic chemistry,"" Dr David Parker, Esa's head of human and robotic exploration, told BBC News. The future of Rosalind Franklin was put in doubt when Russia invaded Ukraine. The diplomatic fallout resulted in the suspension of the mission because it planned to not only use a Russian rocket to get off Earth, but also a Russian landing mechanism to get down to the surface of Mars. Western sanctions made such a joint undertaking impossible.Officials have since been talking to their US counterparts about a transatlantic tie-up.This would see the American space agency (Nasa) launch the rover, with European industry then taking on the responsibility for building the entry, descent and landing mechanism.Nasa's interest would be served by ensuring Rosalind Franklin's key instrument reaches Mars. This chemistry lab, called the Mars Organic Molecule Analyser, was part-developed at the Goddard Space Flight Center in the US State of Maryland.At its Esa's regular council meeting on Thursday, member-state delegations were presented with the rationale for continuing with the mission. The showcase was reportedly greeted at its conclusion with an enthusiastic round of applause.The next step is for European research ministers to approve a budget for the reconfiguration. They will have an opportunity to do this in a few weeks when they gather in Paris to set Esa's near-term programmatic goals.The â¬360m request will initiate the design work on the landing mechanism, although it should be stated that some of this money also covers the ongoing costs of Europe's Trace Gas Orbiter. This satellite, which is already at Mars, is supposed to be the communications relay for Rosalind Franklin when it finally arrives.The rover itself will need some modifications. Principal among these is the removal of two Russian scientific instruments on board, and the installation of American radioisotope heaters to keep the robot warm in the freezing environment of the Red Planet.In addition, engineers are thinking of making some upgrades. One of these could be a shake mode that would enable Rosalind Franklin to periodically rid itself of the Martian dust that over time would gather on its solar panels and reduce their efficiency.Dr Parker said next month's budget request would not be sufficient to get the rover to the launch pad in 2028, and that further development funds would be required later in the decade.Rosalind Franklin was assembled in an ultra-clean facility at the Stevenage, UK, factory of aerospace manufacturer Airbus. The company is hopeful the rover modifications can also be carried out in Britain.The rover and the Trace Gas Orbiter, collectively referred to as the ExoMars project, have so far cost Esa member states well in excess of â¬1bn. The UK alone has invested more than â¬300m, with most of this money geared to the production of the wheeled robot.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63336201,/news/science_and_environment
50,Poland probably hit by Ukrainian missile - Nato,"Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has told the BBC that a missile which killed two people in Poland on Tuesday was probably Ukrainian.""Most likely this is a Ukrainian air defence missile,"" he said as investigations continued into the blast near the Ukrainian border.But he stressed that Russia was ultimately to blame because of its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.Ukraine itself continues to say that Russia actually fired the missile.""I have no doubt that this is not our missile,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in televised remarks. ""I believe that this was a Russian missile, based on our military reports.""He said it was imperative for Ukraine to be allowed to join the investigation into the blast on the farm in Przewodow, 6km (4 miles) from the border.Ukrainian air defence systems were activated on Tuesday when Russia launched what is believed to be its biggest wave of missile strikes in the nine months since the invasion on 24 February.   Dozens of Russian missiles targeted the country but Ukraine says it managed to shoot most of them down.  The mass attack, which occurred during the G20 summit in Indonesia, caused an international outcry, while news of a missile blast inside Nato member Poland's territory raised fears that the war might be escalating dangerously.Mr Stoltenberg said Nato had pledged in response to supply a ""more advanced air defence system"" to Ukraine which is not a member of the alliance but receives extensive military aid. ""Today I attended a meeting of a support group for Ukraine where Nato allies and partners made new pledges for more advanced air defence systems so we can help to shoot down Russian missiles,"" the Nato chief said.""But the best way to prevent any instances like this in the future is for Russia to stop war.""""We have no indication that this is a deliberate attack from Russia,"" he said, speaking from Nato's headquarters in Brussels..He added, however, that there was ""no doubt that Russia is responsible because this would not have happened if Russia had not launched a barrage of missile attacks against Ukrainian cities yesterday, as they have done many times before during this war"".Polish President Andrzej Duda said earlier that although a Russian-made S-300 missile was most likely to blame, there was no evidence it had been fired by the Russian side. When asked about the possibility of peace negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv, Mr Stoltenberg said previous attempts had shown that Russia's President Vladimir Putin had ""no willingness to compromise and negotiate"".""We have to understand if Putin and Russia stop fighting we will have peace but if Zelensky and Ukraine stop fighting, then Ukraine will cease to exist as an independent sovereign nation,"" he said.The top US general also commented on the war on Wednesday, saying there might be a ""political solution where, politically, the Russians withdraw"" from Ukraine.But Army Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned that an early military victory for Ukraine was unlikely despite its recent successes on the battlefield. ""The probability of a Ukrainian military victory - defined as kicking the Russians out of all of Ukraine to include what they claim as Crimea - the probability of that happening any time soon is not high, militarily,"" he told reporters at the Pentagon.",Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg tells the BBC Ukraine's air defences probably caused Tuesday's deadly blast.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63656664,/news/world
51,Donald Trump says he'll run for president in 2024,"Former US President Donald Trump has launched his third bid for the White House, declaring: ""America's comeback starts right now.""At his Florida estate, he said: ""We have to save our country.""Mr Trump's announcement comes as some fellow Republicans blame him for the party's lacklustre performance in last week's midterm elections.President Joe Biden, who defeated Mr Trump two years ago, has said he may run for re-election in 2024.Speaking to an invited crowd from the ballroom of his Mar-a-Lago private club in Palm Beach on Tuesday night, Mr Trump, 76, said: ""We are a nation in decline. ""For millions of Americans, the past two years under Joe Biden have been a time of pain, hardship, anxiety and despair.""He continued: ""In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.""Shortly before the speech, he filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission formally declaring his presidential candidacy and setting up a fundraising account.Outside Mar-a-Lago, supporters gathered to wave Trump 2024 flags.Mr Trump's speech lasted for more than an hour and touched on many of the same themes he had been repeating on stage for months. These included border security, energy independence and crime, as well as attacks on Mr Biden's record in office.His wife, Melania Trump, joined him on stage at the end of the speech. But there were fewer family members present than at some of his past events and Ivanka Trump and Donald Jr did not attend.Following Mr Trump's announcement, Ivanka, who had previously served as a senior adviser in her father's administration, released a statement saying she was taking a step back from politics and would not be involved in the 2024 campaign. ""This time around, I am choosing to prioritise my young children and the private life we are creating as a family,"" she wrote.Nearly 11,000 miles (17,700km) away at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, Mr Biden, 79, was asked whether he had a reaction to Mr Trump's announcement.""No, not really,"" the Democratic president said. Last week, he was filmed laughing when a reporter suggested Mr Trump's support base remained strong.Mr Trump's unusually early declaration for the election of 5 November 2024 is being seen as a tactic to steal a march on potential rivals for the Republicans' White House nomination.Although Mr Trump is the first to enter the race and instantly becomes the front-runner, he is expected to face challengers.They may include his own former Vice-President, Mike Pence, who is 63, and rising star Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, 44.In Tuesday's remarks, Mr Trump largely steered clear of rehashing his baseless claims that the 2020 election had been stolen from him by mass voter fraud.He left office after one term in 2021, refusing to acknowledge his defeat by seven million votes.His debunked conspiracy theories riled up supporters who rioted at Capitol Hill in the final days of his presidency as lawmakers met to certify President Biden's victory.Mr Trump became the first president ever to be impeached twice, although congressional Democrats were thwarted in their bid to remove him from office by Senate Republicans.He ploughed ahead with his announcement on Tuesday despite pleas from advisers to postpone until after a run-off election for a Senate seat in Georgia next month, amid fears his candidacy could prove too much of a distraction.Some conservatives have blamed Mr Trump for the Republicans' failure to achieve sweeping victories in last week's midterm elections.The party is on the verge of taking power in the US House of Representatives, but it would be by a razor-thin margin.Democrats have retained control of the Senate and may even bolster their majority after the December run-off in Georgia.Last week's results were decidedly mixed for congressional hopefuls endorsed by Mr Trump.Candidates he supported in key states such as Pennsylvania, Arizona and Michigan were defeated after echoing his election conspiracies, while others won in Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina.Mr Trump's White House bid comes as he is investigated on several fronts, including a justice department investigation into the removal of files marked classified from the White House to Mar-a-Lago at the end of his presidency. He is admired by conservatives for installing three Supreme Court justices and enacting sweeping tax cuts, as well as presiding over a Middle East peace deal and the killing of Islamic State's leader.But America's divisions widened during his four tumultuous years in office as he was accused of governing by tweet, equivocating over far-right violence, a chaotic response to the coronavirus pandemic, and alienating US allies with his ""America First"" policy.",The announcement sets up a possible rematch of 2020's bitter contest with President Joe Biden.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63463738,/news/world
52,Xi criticises Trudeau in awkward exchange at G20,"China's Xi Jinping has been filmed accusing Justin Trudeau of leaking meeting details, days after they held talks at the G20 summit in Bali.President Xi told the Canadian PM, via a translator, this was inappropriate and accused him of lacking ""sincerity"".He was likely referring to reports that Mr Trudeau discussed alleged Chinese espionage and interference in Canadian elections at the sit down.The talks, which happened behind closed doors, were the pair's first in years.In the footage, filmed by journalists at the now finished gathering of world leaders, President Xi and Mr Trudeau can be seen standing close to each other and conversing via a translator.""Everything we discussed has been leaked to the papers and that is not appropriate,"" the Chinese leader told Mr Trudeau in Mandarin.It captures a rare candid moment of President Xi, whose image is normally carefully curated by Chinese state media.After smiling and nodding his head, the Canadian PM responded by saying ""in Canada we believe in free and open and frank dialogue and that is what we will continue to have"".""We will continue to look to work constructively together but there will be things we disagree on,"" he added.Before Mr Trudeau could finish, President Xi cut his counterpart off and asked that he first ""create the conditions"" - eventually shaking Trudeau's hand and walking away.The short but revealing exchange highlighted tensions between China and Canada, running high since the detention of Huawei Technologies executive Meng Wanzhou in 2018 and Beijing's subsequent arrest of two Canadians on spying charges. All three were later released.But tensions recently resurged following the arrest of Yuesheng Wang, a public utility worker at Hydro-Quebec, who was charged with espionage.Mr Wang ""obtained trade secrets to benefit the People's Republic of China, to the detriment of Canada's economic interests,"" Canadian police said in a statement.At the time, Mr Trudeau and President Xi were at the G20 summit on the Indonesian island of Bali.

53,Family's grief at Zambian's shock death in Ukraine,"The death of a 23-year-old Zambian student who had been recruited to fight for Russia in Ukraine has left the family devastated, his older sister has told the BBC.It's not just that he has died but also the unanswered questions over the young man's brutal death in a foreign land.Lemekhani Nyirenda was serving a drugs-related prison sentence in Russia but was freed and deployed to the front lines in Ukraine.""We want to know how he was conscripted without his family being notified? Was he coerced?"" asked Muzang'alu Nyirenda.The family felt ""robbed"" by her brother's death, she added.Zambia's Foreign Affairs Minister Stanley Kakubo announced on Monday that Mr Nyirenda, who had been studying at the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, was serving a nine-year prison sentence for a drug offence.He said Mr Nyirenda was killed on the front lines in September, but Russian authorities had only just informed Zambia of the death.  Mr Kakubo said that Zambia had demanded answers over the student's death and why he had been sent to Ukraine. Most Zambians are shocked by the news, but also frustrated that the government has not shared more information to explain the circumstances that led to the student being deployed to Ukraine. According to Ms Nyirenda, her brother travelled to Russia in 2019 to study nuclear engineering on a government sponsorship, a partnership between the two countries which dates back many years. ""There is so much we don't know. Why didn't the Zambian government know he was being sent to war to fight?"" his older sister told the BBC.""The people that took him to that war looked down on us as a family, he was nothing to them. They used him,"" she said.Mr Nyirenda was working as a part-time courier when he was arrested in 2020 with a parcel containing drugs, his sister said. ""We believe he didn't know what was in the package he delivered, he told us he didn't. He would get text messages for pick-ups and instructions on where to deliver them,"" she said. ""On one occasion he was stopped by the police and searched and they found drugs in the package. He explained he was working for an online courier and didn't know about the parcels but he was arrested,"" Ms Nyirenda said.The family, however, always remained hopeful that he would return home safely.  But while he was serving his term at a medium security prison he was recruited, his family believe, by the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary group that has been conscripting prisoners to fight for Russia in Ukraine in exchange for their freedom.In September, leaked footage showed Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner group, outlining the rules of fighting, such as no deserting or sexual contact with Ukrainian women, and then giving the prisoners five minutes to decide if they want to sign up.Ominously, he told the prisoners he would get them out of jail alive but said he could not promise to bring them back to alive.Born to university professionals Edwin and Florence Nyirenda, Lemekhani was the youngest of four children. Even while in prison he found a way to communicate with his loved-ones in Zambia.The last time his parents heard from him was on 31 August on a cryptic phone call that filled them with concern.""He told my parents: 'I am no longer in prison but where I am is confidential'. My parents were worried, we all were when he shared this. We knew he was a prisoner in a foreign country where he had no rights, we were worried about what was going but he could not share more and my parents didn't probe him further,"" Ms Nyirenda said. The family notified the Zambian authorities of the odd call and were assured of an investigation into his whereabouts, but months later came the news of the young man's death.""He was young, they stole his life away from him. He's got a twin brother, they've stolen my brother's other half,"" his sister said through tears.""Lemekhani had so many plans. He was studying so he could come back and pamper my mother. He had plans to help rebuild Zambia. They've robbed us,"" she said. ""There is no closure, only questions. We want him home so we can lay him to rest in peace. We want him back with the people who love him but we deserve answers,"" said Ms Nyirenda.His body, according to Zambian officials, has been transported to Russia's southern border town of Rostov in preparation for his repatriation to Lusaka where his family will bury him. Further inquiries by the BBC to Zambia's ministry of foreign affairs have gone unanswered. Zambia has taken a neutral position on the Russia-Ukraine war, like many other African countries, but says it condemns any form of war.",Lemekhani Nyirenda's sister tells the BBC she wants to know why her brother was fighting for Russia.,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-63648681,/news/world
54,Five protesters receive death sentences in Iran,"Four people have been sentenced to death on the charge of ""enmity against God"" in connection with the recent anti-government protests in Iran.Revolutionary Courts in Tehran said one of the unnamed ""rioters"" hit and killed a policeman with his car, the judiciary's Mizan news agency said.The second possessed a knife and a gun, and the third blocked traffic and caused ""terror"", it alleged.The fourth was convicted of a knife attack, Mizan reported late on Tuesday.Human rights activists condemned the death sentences - which brought the total to five since Sunday - saying they were the results of unfair trials.""Protesters don't have access to lawyers in the interrogation phase, they are subjected to physical and mental torture to give false confessions, and sentenced based on the confessions,"" the director of Norway-based Iran Human Rights, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, told AFP news agency.Although the judiciary did not disclose the identities of the five individuals sentenced to death, Amnesty International said information about their charges had led human rights activists to believe they were Mohammad Ghobadlou, Manouchehr Mehman Navaz, Mahan Sedarat Madani, Mohammad Boroughani and Sahand Nourmohammad-Zadeh.It added that they were among at least 21 detainees charged with security-related offences that are punishable by death under Iran's Sharia-based legal system, including ""enmity against God"" and ""corruption on Earth"".At least 348 protesters have been killed and 15,900 others arrested in a crackdown by security forces on what Iran's leaders have portrayed as foreign-backed ""riots"", according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which is also based outside the country. The women-led protests against clerical rule erupted after the death in custody three months ago of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly breaking the strict rules on hijabs.The judiciary's announcements came after 12 people were reportedly killed amid a fresh wave of unrest that began on Tuesday.Activists called for three days of demonstrations and strikes to commemorate ""Bloody November"" - a reference to the deadly crackdown on the last major nationwide protests that began on 15 November 2019, when many Iranians reacted angrily to a sudden increase in fuel prices. Videos posted on social media on Tuesday showed crowds in Tehran and other major cities chanting slogans against the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, including ""death to the dictator"". At a metro station in the capital, protesters set fire to a headscarf on a platform as a crowd shouted that Ayatollah Khamenei ""will be toppled"". Another video from a metro station appeared to show officers beating people inside a train carriage, while in a third, people were seen running and falling over as security forces allegedly opened fire.On Wednesday night, state media reported that at least five people were killed when armed ""terrorist elements"" opened fire at protesters and police officers at a market in the south-western city of Izeh. The deputy governor Khuzestan province said the dead included three men, a woman and a girl.Opposition activist collective 1500tasvir also said it had received reports of a high number of casualties in Izeh and accused security forces of killing a 10-year-old boy. It also posted a video that it said showed some protesters setting fire to a seminary in the city.Earlier, Kurdish human rights group Hengaw reported that a male protester was shot and killed by security forces in the north-western city of Kamyaran, in Mahsa Amini's home province of Kurdistan.He had been standing near the house of another man who was killed by direct fire from security forces on Tuesday, it said. Another two men were also killed in the nearby city of Sanandaj, it added.Hengaw, which is based in Norway, also said that protesters seized control of the city of Bukan, in neighbouring West Azerbaijan province, on Tuesday night. State media reported that ""rioters"" shot dead two members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including a colonel, in Bukan and Kamyaran on Tuesday. They also said that a cleric who was a member of the paramilitary Basij Resistance Force, which is controlled by the IRGC, died after being hit by a Molotov cocktail in the southern city of Shiraz.State media have so far reported the deaths of 38 security personnel since the protests began.

55,"UVA shooting victims were targeted, court hears","Three football players who were shot and killed at the University of Virginia were deliberately targeted, prosecutors allege.New details emerged as the suspect appeared in court for the first time since the late Sunday shooting, which also injured two others.A judge on Wednesday ordered that the suspect be held without bond.He did not enter a plea on Wednesday and was temporarily appointed a public defender. Christopher Darnell Jones Jr, 22, allegedly opened fire on his schoolmates on a bus after they had just returned to campus from a field trip to see a play in Washington DC.He is charged with three counts of second degree murder and three counts of using a handgun. Prosecutors say a witness reported the suspect appeared to target specific people and shot one of the victims while he was sleeping. Those killed were identified as Devin Chandler, a second-year student from Virginia Beach, D'Sean Perry, a fourth-year student from Miami, Florida, and Lavel Davis, a third-year student from Rich Hill, South Carolina - all of whom are members of the University of Virginia football team.One person who was injured remains in hospital in serious condition, while the other has been discharged.The shooting took place around 22:30 (03:30 GMT) on Sunday at the university's Charlottesville campus. The suspect remained at-large overnight, forcing the university into a 12-hour lockdown as police looked for the gunman.He was arrested early Monday afternoon. The court on Wednesday also heard from prosecutors that the suspect was charged and convicted of reckless driving and a hit and run in 2021, and faced a concealed weapons charge that same year.Vigils were held on campus after the shooting, and classes were cancelled Monday and Tuesday.On Wednesday, the school said it has cancelled its final football home game of the season, scheduled for Saturday. The suspect is next expected to appear in court for a hearing on 8 December.

56,"Work long hours or leave, Musk tells Twitter staff","Elon Musk has told Twitter staff that they must commit to working ""long hours at high intensity"" or else leave the company, according to reports.In an email to staff, the social media firm's new owner said workers should agree to the pledge if they wanted to stay, the Washington Post reported.Those who do not sign up by Thursday will be given three months' severance pay, Mr Musk said.The BBC has contacted Twitter for comment.In his email to staff, also seen by The Guardian, Mr Musk said that Twitter ""will need to be extremely hardcore"" in order to succeed.""This will mean working long hours at high intensity. Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade,"" he said.Workers were told that they needed to click on a link by 17:00 EST on Thursday, if they want to be ""part of the new Twitter"".He added: ""Whatever decision you make, thank you for your efforts to make Twitter successful.""The world's richest man has already announced half of Twitter's staff are being let go, after he bought the company in a $44bn (Â£38.7bn) deal.Mr Musk said he had ""no choice"" over the cuts as the company was losing $4m (Â£3.51m) a day. He has blamed ""activist groups pressuring advertisers"" for a ""massive drop in revenue"".A host of top Twitter executives have also stepped down following his purchase of the firm.Last week, the entrepreneur told Twitter staff that remote working would end and ""difficult times"" lay ahead, according to reports.In an email to staff, the owner of the social media firm said workers would be expected in the office for at least 40 hours a week, Bloomberg reported.Mr Musk added that there was ""no way to sugar coat the message"" that the slowing global economy was going to hit Twitter's advertising revenues.But tech investor Sarah Kunst said the real reason Twitter is facing difficulties is because Mr Musk's takeover has saddled the company with debt. His behaviour since the takeover has also led some advertisers to pause their spending, she said. ""He's now trying to inflict that pain and uncertainty on the employees,"" she said.She added that there was a question mark over how enforceable Mr Musk's email about hours to staff really was.""Can you just send an email to staff who already work for you, and just unilaterally change their working contract? That remains to be seen.""Mr Musk himself has been sleeping at Twitter in recent weeks, even while leading electric carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX.He described his work habits in a US court on Wednesday, where he appeared to defend the eye-popping $56bn pay package he received from electric carmaker Tesla in 2018.""I pretty much work all the time, with rare exceptions."" he said. In response to questioning, he later added that the ""fundamental organisational restructuring"" at Twitter would be complete by the end of this week.Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, warned it was further evidence that Twitter's culture had ""dramatically changed"" with Mr Musk at the helm.""Elon Musk is not going to be doing candlelight dinners and playing ping pong in Twitter's cafeteria and this is a shock to the system,"" he said.""But he also needs to play nice in the sandbox because if key Twitter engineers and developers leave, this will be a major void in the Twitter ecosystem,"" he warned. ""There's a careful balance ahead for him, in this tightrope act.""Do you work long hours either willingly or because you feel you have no choice?

57,Malta moves to ease EU's last total ban on abortion,"Malta's government is to propose a change in the law to allow doctors to terminate a pregnancy if a mother's life or health is at risk.The small Mediterranean state has the only total abortion ban in the EU.Ministers promised to review the law when a US tourist was denied an abortion after she began to miscarry.Andrea Prudente, who was 16 weeks pregnant, was told doctors could do nothing while the baby's heart was still beating.Facing a potentially deadly infection she asked for an abortion and after days of waiting she was eventually allowed to fly to Spain.Maltese Health Minister Chris Fearne said a legal amendment would go before parliament in the coming days to ensure doctors were now legally protected in cases of medical complication that left a mother's life at risk or her health in grave jeopardy due to the pregnancy.Malta's criminal code currently says any doctor who knowingly provides a woman with the means for a termination faces a jail term of 18 months to four years and a permanent professional ban. Any woman who arranges her own termination is also liable to face jail, although no woman is thought to have faced criminal charges in years.Last July Ms Prudente told the BBC that a midwife at Mater Dei hospital in Malta had told her that doctors might intervene ""when I would be on the 'brink of death'"". However, the head of the Malta College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said they would have never allowed her condition to deteriorate to that extent.Pro-choice gynaecologist Isabel Stabile, one of 135 doctors in Malta who challenged the law, said the government had confirmed that the last blanket ban on abortion in the EU would end.She said the change was a ""step in the right direction"" but did not go far enough: ""There will still not be any provision to terminate pregnancies in cases of rape or incest, or in cases of fatal, fetal anomaly."" The health minister said the spirit of the law and medical ethics was to save lives, so the change ensured that the principle was enshrined in law.Prime Minister Robert Abela told The Times of Malta earlier this month that women had told him that he had to recognise the reality that women were unable to seek medical help if they suffered complications for fear of being sent to jail.""These past months I've met tens of women who aborted using a tablet. Conservatively, around 300 or 350 women abort this way every year,"" he said. ""All these women told me the same thing: that they had been stigmatised and that none of them had found any sort of support.""Malta is a predominantly Catholic country and a recent survey indicated 61.8% of people were completely opposed to abortion.Some Maltese have argued that the law has acted as a deterrent. ""When mothers are faced with life-threatening conditions then doctors can intervene,"" Christian Briffa of anti-abortion youth group, I See Life, told the BBC during the summer.But Justice Minister Jonathan Attard said the reform would remove any form of doubt and ensure patients received the best healthcare.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63650476,/news/world
58,Nasa's Artemis Moon rocket lifts off Earth,"The American space agency Nasa has launched its most powerful ever rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The 100m-tall Artemis vehicle climbed skyward in a stupendous mix of light and sound.Its objective was to hurl an astronaut capsule in the direction of the Moon.This spacecraft, known as Orion, is uncrewed for this particular flight, but if everything works as it should, people will climb aboard for future missions that go to the lunar surface.Wednesday's flight followed two previous launch attempts in August and September that were aborted during the countdown because of technical woes.    But such issues were overcome on this occasion, and the Space Launch System, as the rocket is often called, was given the ""go"" to begin its ascent from the Kennedy Space Center at 01:47 local time (06:47 GMT).""Today, we got to witness the world's most powerful rocket take the Earth by its edges and shake the wicked out of it,"" said Mike Sarafin, Nasa's Artemis mission manager. ""We have a priority one mission in play right now."" His boss, the agency's administrator Bill Nelson, was also wowed.""That's the biggest flame I've ever seen. It's the most acoustical shockwave that I have ever experienced,"" he commented. ""I have to say what we saw tonight was an A+. But we have still a long ways to go. This is just a test flight.""The rocket had a number of important manoeuvres to perform high above the planet to get the Orion capsule on the right path to the Moon. All were performed ""outstandingly"", said John Honeycutt, Nasa's SLS programme manager. The ship will now rely on its European propulsion module to shepherd it safely on the rest of the mission.Josef Aschbacher is director general of the European Space Agency (Esa): ""We have to make sure that Orion is powered safely to the Moon, circles the Moon, and then, as you know, we have to bring it back safely to Earth, making sure that the entry of the capsule into the atmosphere is on the right trajectory and at the right angle so that it can land in the Pacific Ocean. Yes, our job starts now, and it's a huge responsibility.""December will see Nasa celebrate the 50th anniversary of Apollo 17, the very last time humans walked on the Moon.The space agency is calling its new programme Artemis (Apollo's twin sister in Greek mythology).It's planning a series of ever more complex missions over the next decade that should result in a more sustained presence at Earth's satellite, with the presence of surface habitats and the use of rovers, together with a mini space station in orbit around the Moon.Nasa hopes will become an inspiration to a new generation. It has promised that women and people of colour will feature in these endeavours, something that didn't happen 50 years ago.""I wanted to be an astronaut from the time that I was five years old."" said astronaut Jessica Meir.  ""For anybody that has a dream or some kind of aspiration, if they see somebody that they can identify with a little bit, it puts them into a totally different perspective where they can say, 'Well, wait a minute, that person was just like me, and they did it so I can do it too'.""Analysis by Rebecca Morelle, BBC News Science EditorIn 1972, Apollo astronaut Gene Cernan left the last set of footprints on the Moon. As he departed from the lunar surface, he said he believed it wouldn't be long before we returned. It's been 50 years. But today, the Moon is within reach for humanity once again.With a roar of its mighty engines, Nasa's new rocket has lifted us into a new era for human spaceflight.Nasa's astronauts watched on - if this mission is a success, next time they will be onboard, first flying around the Moon, and then landing on it.But we're not there yet. The Orion spacecraft may be on its way, but it has more than a million miles of travel ahead. It has to reach the Moon, orbit around it, and then return home. Nasa has to show this system is safe before any astronauts can be strapped in for the ride.Orion is being sent on a 26-day excursion that will take it into what's called a distant retrograde orbit at the Moon.At its closest, the capsule will be a mere 100km from the lunar surface; at its most distant, Orion will be up to 70,000km (45,000 miles). This will be the furthest from Earth any human-rated spacecraft has ever ventured.The capsule is due back on Earth on 11 December - about three and a half weeks from now. That's when one of the key events in the whole mission occurs.Engineers are most concerned to learn that Orion's heatshield will cope with the extreme temperatures it will encounter on re-entry to our planet's atmosphere.The capsule will be coming in very fast - at 38,000km/h (24,000mph), or 32 times the speed of sound.A shield on its underside must cope with temperatures approaching 3,000C.The United Kingdom is playing its part in the Artemis adventure, and not just as a member state of the European Space Agency.On Wednesday, the Goonhilly Earth Station in Cornwall picked up the Orion ship's radio signal as it came off the top of the rocket. By analysing the shift in frequencies as the capsule moved through space, it enabled Nasa to more actually calculate the trajectory for a later course correction.Goonhilly will be sending commands to six of the 10 small satellites that were also lofted by the SLS rocket.""We started our company here less than 12 years ago with an ambition to do deep space communication,"" explained Goonhilly CEO Ian Jones.""We thought we'd be picking up scraps here and there by now, not to be actually commanding spacecraft on Nasa's first return to the Moon, which is brilliant.""",,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63643707,/news/world
59,Hold next COP in the Amazon - Lula,"Brazil is back, president-elect Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has told rapturous crowds at the UN climate summit COP27 in Egypt.Walking into a room of supporters singing his name, Lula promised to restore the Amazon rainforest and chase down climate criminals.Huge numbers gathered to see him speak, making him one of the superstars of this summit.Nations are meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh to discuss tackling climate change.  Just two weeks after his narrow election win, Lula is making his first appearance on the international stage, meeting leaders including from the US, China and the EU at the climate conference.""We must stop this rush to the abyss. There is no climate security for the world without a protected Amazon,"" he said, saying climate change would have the highest priority for his government.""We will do whatever it takes to have zero deforestation and the degradation of our biomes.""While there is no doubt Brazil's president is full of ambition when it comes to tackling climate change, analysts say the challenge will be to make these promises come true.Brazil is deeply divided over Lula's return to power and his job to unite the country won't be easy.The president told the summit that Brazil would prove that it was possible to generate wealth without destroying the environment, saying it was impossible to separate tackling global warming from poverty.Striking a harder tone, he said Brazil would ensure that developing nations got the money they are owed to deal with the effects of climate change.He also pledged to protect indigenous people, whose land has been targeted under current President Jair Bolsonaro. Indigenous people in traditional dress stood up cheering and shaking maracas.But Lula faces an uphill battle at home in Brazil where he faces significant opposition in Congress and a divided society.Under Mr Bolsonaro, who will hand over power to Lula in January, deforestation of the Amazon reached record highs.Puyr TembÃ©, an indigenous leader from heavily deforested ParÃ¡ state, told BBC News that Mr Bolsonaro completely dismantled laws protecting the Amazon. On Tuesday US climate envoy John Kerry said he was confident Lula would bring a complete turnaround on Brazil's approach to the environment.Former environment minister in Brazil Isabella Teixeira told BBC News that ""the world"" is now ""embracing Brazil at COP27"".Reflecting the challenges at home, Lula told the summit there was just one Brazil and he would govern for all.In order to make progress on his agenda, Ms Teixeira said Lula would need to convince people and Congress members to agree, not disagree with each other.  Lula must reverse Mr Bolsonaro's legacy by rebuilding the environmental protection agencies, unfreezing the Amazon Fund which promotes conservation, and tackling criminals in the Amazon, according to Marcio Astrini, executive secretary of Brazil's Climate Observatory network.He says that civil society will not hesitate to challenge the new government it if fails to keep its promises. ""When the government is succeeding, we will support them, but if it fails, we will criticise them."" But Brazil and the world must be prepared for ""mistakes and failures"", suggests Roberto Waack, a business leader and chair of ArapyaÃº Institute.  ""Climate a complicated problem, Lula has ambitious pledges and we will face disappointments because of the political situation in Brazil,"" he said. ""You can't just say stop deforestation and the next day the problem is solved,"" he said. On Tuesday, young Brazilian activists at COP27 met Lula. ""It was hugely emotional, I cried a lot. It is unbelievable to feel part of Brazil again,"" Gabrielle Alves, an environmental racism researcher who is part of the Clima de MudanÃ§a coalition, told BBC News.Behind the scenes, negotiations between nations are ongoing at COP27 with a final agreement expected on Friday or Saturday. However there are still wide divisions between countries on key issues. The question of who will pay the bill for irreversible climate damage remains hotly debated, as developing countries want finance urgently earmarked to cover their losses. But developed nations are resisting any question of compensation from countries who historically caused the majority of emissions. There is concern too that the crucial aim to limiting temperature rise to 1.5C - which scientists say is crucial to avoiding the worst effects of climate change - is in jeopardy.

60,Novak Djokovic Australia visa ban overturned,"The path has been cleared for Novak Djokovic to play in the Australian Open, after the Australian government overturned a visa ban.The Serbian tennis star was detained in January over his refusal to be vaccinated against Covid.He was deported from the country 10 days later, despite mounting a successful legal challenge.At times dubbed ""Fortress Australia"", the country had some of the strictest pandemic restrictions in the world.When Djokovic arrived in Australia in January, Covid cases were skyrocketing and government rules required anyone entering the country be vaccinated, unless they had a valid medication exemption.He did not meet the requirements for entry, the government said, so his visa was cancelled and he was automatically banned from entering the country for three years.But Immigration Minister Andrew Giles - whose government came to power in May - has overturned the ban and is set to grant Mr Djokovic a visa, the BBC has confirmed.Speaking earlier on Tuesday, Tennis Australia boss Craig Tiley said he was confident that Djokovic would play in next year's Open.""I know Novak wants to come and play and to get back to competing,"" he told the Australian Associated Press.""He loves Australia and it's where he's had the best success.""The tennis champion earlier this year told the BBC he flew into Australia believing he had obtained the medical exemptions required.But he was detained and questioned by border officials in Melbourne on 5 January, and his visa was cancelled in the early hours of the following morning.Djokovic was taken to a notorious immigration detention hotel, where he remained as he challenged the decision in court.The court later overturned the decision to cancel his visa, but then-Immigration Minister Alex Hawke used special discretionary powers to cancel it again, arguing it was ""in the public interest"" to do so.In court documents, Mr Hawke said Djokovic was ""perceived by some as a talisman of a community of anti-vaccine sentiment"" and his presence in the tournament could lead to ""civil unrest"".Many in Australia cheered the decision but it also sparked an uproar among supporters who gathered outside his hotel, as well as in Serbia.

61,Searching for clues about Poland missile strike,"Poland's military was placed on high alert on Tuesday evening after a missile landed on its territory killing two people.It came as Russia fired dozens of missiles at targets in Ukraine and Ukrainian forces tried to shoot them down with its own missiles - part of its air defence system. As the Polish authorities - along with Nato allies - try to establish the facts, the BBC's open source investigations team has been analysing reports and studying images on social media to try to uncover more details about the incident.The explosion was first reported in the Polish media on Tuesday evening, describing a blast close to the Polish village of Przewodow, about 6km (4 miles) from the Ukrainian border.Initial reports said the missile had landed next to an area of a farm where employees load and weigh grain, destroying a nearby building.We examined satellite images (which showed only one farm in the village) and cross-referenced them with photographs taken at ground level on Wednesday morning to locate the site - which has been confirmed by the Polish authorities. We also examined a video which was posted on social media late on Tuesday.It claims to show the immediate aftermath of an explosion as a missile ""fell on Polish territory"". A column of smoke can be seen (we're showing a grab of the video on the left of the graphic below). There are visual clues in the video that we believe appear to match the site in Przewodow. A road seen in the video (highlighted by us in red) has a similar pattern to one seen in an aerial image of the area - it bends to the left, then to the right. The road forks in front of a light-coloured building (highlighted by us in orange).Photographs taken on the ground on Wednesday (seen in the first graphic) show a light-coloured housing block near the farm. And the vegetation and lines of trees appear similar too. We've tried to contact the person who posted this video in order to verify it further but haven't yet had a response.Images from the blast site also began circulating on social media late on Tuesday, showing a crater and a damaged tractor and trailer.It was difficult to locate these on their own because of the dark and a lack of wider visual clues. But an image posted on social media by Polish police on Wednesday morning shows officers examining the scene. The same trailer, spilled grain and debris can be seen in both images. Another picture circulating on social media on Tuesday night - which was widely shared - shows a fragment from a missile that it was claimed was found at the scene. Based on this image alone, the BBC has so far been unable to verify that it was found at the same location because of the lack of wider visual clues in the photo.  On Wednesday, a BBC correspondent on the ground was unable to get close to the scene, which has been sealed off by the Polish authorities.We have shown it to defence experts and asked them whether they can work out what type of missile this was from, and who might have fired it. Mark Cancian, from the think tank CSIS, believes it may be from an S-300 system. This type of missile is typically used for surface-to-air attacks, and has been used by both Russia and Ukraine throughout the war.""Who fired the missile is unclear,"" says J AndrÃ©s Gannon, a security expert at the US Council on Foreign Relations, who agrees that it may be from an S-300 system.""We know Russia has been using the S-300 for ground attacks, even though it's an air defence system, but Ukraine also uses them for air defence against cruise missiles.""Dr Justin Bronk, a senior fellow at think tank Rusi, agrees that it may be from an S-300 system, but there isn't enough evidence to identify it yet.The Polish prime minister said it was highly likely the missile was fired by Ukraine during their defence against Russian attacks.US President Joe Biden has said it was ""unlikely"" that the missile was fired from Russia, with US officials' initial findings indicating it was fired by Ukrainian air defences.Russia's closest point to the blast site in Poland is about 580km (360 miles) away, far further than the range of the S-300 system which experts say is around 90km (56 miles). Both Russia and Ukraine possess these S-300 weapons and accuse each other of causing damage with them in recent attacks.The Ukrainians use them to shoot down Russian missiles, and the Russians have claimed these have fallen to the ground and caused civilian casualties.It is very difficult to tell the origin of a missile from its debris, according to weapons experts.There has been speculation that Russia may have been targeting sites in Ukraine close to this stretch of the Polish border.About 10km (6 miles) from the village, just across the border into Ukraine, is the Dobrotvirska power plant. An active power line connecting Poland with Ukraine is also nearby. Russia has been targeting infrastructure sites such as these and Ukrainian forces have been using anti-missile defences to counter them. We are continuing to investigate this incident and will update this piece when we get further details.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/63648958,/news/world
62,Six ways it's harder for Trump to run this time,"Donald Trump has announced his third straight presidential bid, in an extremely rare attempt by a former US leader to recapture the White House after losing an election.The speech, which clocked in at more than an hour, was largely a mix of boasts about his presidential record and attacks on the first two years of Joe Biden's presidency. On display were some of Mr Trump's continued strengths. He has an unmatched sense of which issues are important to grass-roots conservatives, such as immigration and crime. His unpredictable and inflammatory style can drive news coverage and deny the spotlight to his competitors. He has a base of loyal supporters and can motivate typically unengaged Americans to vote. And after four years in office, many of those supporters hold positions of authority within the Republican Party.But his speech also highlighted some of Mr Trump's key weaknesses.He glossed over the hardships and missteps during the Covid pandemic and totally ignored his months of election denial that culminated in the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by a mob of his supporters. He attempted to defend the Republican Party's tepid performance in last week's midterm election and his support for losing candidates, which has led to growing criticism from conservative ranks.Mr Trump said the task ahead was not one for a ""conventional candidate"", but for a movement of millions of people - his movement, his people and his campaign. He rode that movement to the presidency six years ago, but there's reason to believe the obstacles that his latest White House bid will face are more daunting this time around. Here's why.Eight years ago, Mr Trump was a political blank slate. With no record as an officeholder, voters could project their hopes and desires on to him. He could make expansive promises - so much winning! - without critics pointing to past shortcomings and failures.That's not the case any more. While Mr Trump had some notable policy achievements during his four years in office, including tax cuts and criminal justice reform, he also had some prominent failures. Republicans will remember his inability to repeal Democratic healthcare reforms and his repeated promises of infrastructure investment that never came to fruition. And then there's Mr Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which could open him up to attacks on multiple fronts. Democrats have long criticised his response as insufficiently aggressive, but there are some on the right who believe he went too far in supporting government-mandated mitigation efforts.Mr Trump won't just have to run on his policy record as president, either. He will have to defend the way he handled the end of his presidency and his role in the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol. The images of that day, with supporters waving Trump banners amid the teargas as they ransacked the Capitol and temporarily halted the peaceful transition of power, will not be easily forgotten.The midterm elections demonstrated that what happened that day - and Mr Trump's words and actions in the weeks leading up to it - may still be influencing voter behaviour. Many Republican candidates who offered full-throated support for Mr Trump's refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election lost. Lots of them underperformed other Republican candidates in their states who were not outspoken in their election denial.One of the reasons floated for why Mr Trump appears so eager to launch another presidential bid is because it will allow him to more effectively frame his multiple criminal and civil investigations as part of a larger political vendetta. While that might work for public relations purposes, Mr Trump's legal exposure in these cases is very real.The former president is currently defending himself against a criminal election-tampering inquiry in Georgia, a civil fraud case targeting his business empire in New York, a defamation lawsuit involving a sexual assault allegation, and federal probes into his role in the Capitol attack and his post-presidential handling of classified material.Any of these investigations could lead to full-blown trials that would dominate the headlines and at least temporarily derail Mr Trump's campaign plans. At best for him, it would be a costly distraction. A worst-case scenario would include massive financial penalties or prison. As the Republican presidential contest began eight years ago, Mr Trump faced off against a Florida governor considered to be the party's prohibitive favourite. Jeb Bush, however, proved a paper tiger. A massive campaign war chest and a famous last name was not enough. He was out of step with the Republican base on immigration and education policy. And the Bush name didn't carry the power within the party that it once did.If Mr Trump wants the nomination in 2024, he may once again have to go through a Florida governor. Unlike Mr Bush, however, Ron DeSantis just won an overwhelming re-election victory that suggests he is in tune with his party's core supporters. While he has yet to be tested on the national stage, his political star is ascending. It's unclear if Mr DeSantis will run, or who else will enter the Republican presidential contest at this point. The Florida governor could emerge as the consensus pick among the party faithful not interested in giving Mr Trump another shot. If so, Republican voters may have the kind of binary choice that will improve their odds of stopping Mr Trump before his nomination is secured.On the eve of Mr Trump's presidential announcement, a conservative group released a series of polls that showed Mr Trump trailing Ron DeSantis in a head-to-head contest by double-digits among Republican voters in Iowa and New Hampshire.Those states hold votes early in the Republican nomination process. Mr DeSantis also led by 26 points in Florida and by 20 in Georgia, which has a Senate run-off election in December. In all these states, Mr Trump's numbers were well down on previous surveys.According to exit polls from the recently concluded midterm elections, Mr Trump is simply not very popular - including in the key states he would need to win to secure the presidency in a general election.In New Hampshire, only 30% of voters said they wanted Mr Trump to run for president again. Even in Florida, that number only rose to 33%.Of course, Mr Trump overcame net-negative views of his candidacy in 2015 as well. But after eight years as a political figure on the national stage, those views may be much less likely to change this time around.If he wins the presidency, Mr Trump would be 78 years old when he's sworn in. And while that's the same age Joe Biden was when he moved in to the White House, it would make him the second-oldest president in US history.Time takes its toll in different ways on different people, but the increasing burdens of age are inevitable. There's no guarantee that Mr Trump can withstand the kind of rigorous campaigning required to win the Republican nomination - particularly one where he will probably be pitted against much younger candidates.Mr Trump has shown remarkable endurance in the past, but every man has his limits.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63638929,/news/world
63,How missiles in Europe dominated a Bali summit,"It was meant to be Indonesia's big reopening party after the pandemic, a chance to show the world it was ready for business and poised for recovery.But in the end, even the best efforts by the host of the G20 Bali summit to keep things on track were no match for a barrage of missiles fired half a world away. On Tuesday night, world leaders sat down for dinner and a lavish concert featuring traditional Balinese dancers and eye-popping laser projections on towering cliffs.Several kilometres away, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was heading towards Ngurah Rai airport. At 21:35 local time (13:35 GMT), he took off in his plane.Organisers said it was a scheduled departure. But it also happened just as Russia fired scores of missiles into Ukraine, hitting key power infrastructure in Kyiv and other cities and killing at least one person.Then, hours later, came troubling reports of two missiles landing in Poland near the border with Ukraine - raising the possibility that Russia may have attacked a Nato member.As officials in Europe and the US scrambled to figure out the situation, US President Joe Biden was roused from his slumber in Bali.He and his team swung into action. As Mr Biden got on the phone with Polish leader Andrzej Duda and Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called his Polish and Ukrainian counterparts. The leaders of the G7 nations - all present in Bali - were then summoned for an emergency hour-long meeting to the Grand Hyatt, where Mr Biden was staying. Afterwards, Mr Biden told reporters he believed it was ""unlikely"" the missile that landed in Poland came from Russia, while condemning Moscow for ""totally unconscionable"" strikes on Ukraine.Mr Biden and many leaders then rushed to a scheduled G20 event at a Balinese mangrove forest. It was a surreal, whiplash moment, going from tense discussions on the Ukraine war straight into a cheery photo-op planting trees.Even as they smiled for the cameras while touring the forest, some could be seen breaking off in private discussions. Mr Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, a key player in attempts to broker peace in Ukraine, stayed close to each other, with Mr Macron furrowing his brow in one particular intense chat.Wednesday was meant to be a day of diplomacy, with a series of carefully orchestrated bilateral meetings held among the various leaders.Those schedules were thrown out of the window with some meetings cancelled, including one between UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Instead, Mr Sunak jumped on a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Canada's leader Justin Trudeau.In the afternoon, the much anticipated final communique of the G20 leaders was released. One big question had been whether members would agree to any kind of unified condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The statement said that ""most members"" condemned the invasion and acknowledged that others had different views - an obvious accommodation of Russia, as well as China and India which have refrained from condemning Moscow's actions.But right at the top it also quoted a strongly-worded UN declaration which ""deplores in the strongest terms"" Russia's actions and demands its ""complete and unconditional withdrawal"". Some leaders have painted this as a win, given that the statement was not vetoed by Russia.In the end, while Indonesia's President Joko Widodo tried to keep the focus of the summit on other key issues such as climate change, the Ukraine war still ended up casting a long shadow. But if nothing else, it did result in a notable degree of consensus and unity in a time of deep divisions.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63647105,/news/world
64,What is LNG and why has it become so important?,"Russia has slashed supplies of natural gas to Europe, forcing countries to find alternative sources of energy.Many countries are relying on liquefied natural gas (LNG) to fill the gap, but so much is now being shipped that tankers are queuing up at ports.LNG is methane, or methane mixed with ethane, cleansed of impurities and cooled to approximately -160C.This turns the gas into a liquid, which takes up 600 times less space. It is then shipped in tankers, like crude oil.At its destination, it is turned back into a gas and used, like any other natural gas, for heating, cooking and power.""Before LNG, gas could only be distributed through pipelines, and that put a limit on where it could be sold,"" says Carole Nakhle, of analysts Crystol Energy.""LNG can be transported across oceans, and so it can get to many more destinations.""The world's largest exporters of LNG are Australia, Qatar and the US.The US has more than doubled its LNG exports to Europe. It delivered 46 million tonnes in the first nine months of 2022, compared with 22 million tonnes in 2021. It has become the continent's biggest supplier.Australia ships almost all its LNG to customers in Asia. Qatar also supplies some LNG to Asia, as well as European countries such as the UK, Belgium, and Italy.Qatar supplied 13 million tonnes of LNG to Europe between January and October 2022, but it sells almost all of its product on long-term contracts. It has been difficult to buy extra supplies from Qatar at short notice.Countries such as Algeria also export LNG to Europe. So does Russia - even if it has cut supplies of gas through pipelines.When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, it was widely condemned by European countries. In response, Russia cut exports of natural gas to Europe by about 80%. The international price of gas increased more than fourfold and household bills soared.Fearing power cuts, the EU signed a deal with the US to import more LNG. Now, LNG accounts for 40% of all the gas EU countries use, according to the European Commission.LNG also makes up half of all the gas which the UK imports - mostly from the US.The extra supplies of LNG have helped to stop gas prices climbing even higher.However, critics point out that the production and transportation of LNG emits ten times as much carbon as piping natural gas. ""American LNG helped Europe out of a tight spot,"" says Kate Dourian, of the Energy Institute. ""But now the market has been saturated because Europe has reached the limits of how much LNG it can take.""  Countries which want to import LNG need plants to offload it and turn it back into gas form. France, the UK, Italy and Spain have built these, but others such as Germany - Europe's biggest gas importer - have not.A lack of LNG terminals in Europe has caused bottlenecks.At the end of October, reports suggested there were 51 LNG tankers in European waters - a lot of them waiting to enter ports.Countries such as Germany and the Netherlands have tried to solve this problem by hiring floating terminals to store and convert the gas.However, even with these, they cannot process all the LNG which is arriving.""These floating terminals are small scale. They cannot process large quantities of LNG quickly,"" says Ms Nakhle. ""Because of that, queues of ships are building up.""There are other reasons why Europe cannot take all the LNG it is being sent.""Countries can't take much more LNG because most of their storage facilities are already full,"" says Ms Dourian.European nations have all been storing up gas for heating use as the weather gets colder, she says, but the weather has been relatively warm this autumn.European countries are planning to build 17 more LNG terminals. This could increase capacity by more than 40%.However, most will only come into operation in 2026. ",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63585732,/news/world
65,Deepfaked: ‘They put my face on a porn video’,"Imagine if your face had been digitally edited into a porn video without your consent and then shared on the internet. One woman reveals the horror of it happening to her. Scrolling through her Twitter feed one evening, Kate Isaacs stumbled across a disturbing video among her notifications.""This panic just washed over me,"" Kate says, speaking publicly for the first time about what happened. ""Someone had taken my face, put it on to a porn video, and made it look like it was me.""Kate had been deepfaked. Someone had used artificial intelligence to digitally manipulate her face onto someone else's - in this case a porn actress.The deepfake video on Twitter - with Kate, who campaigns against non-consensual porn, tagged - had been made using footage from TV interviews she had given while campaigning. It appeared to show her having sex.""My heart sank. I couldn't think clearly,"" she says. ""I remember just feeling like this video was going to go everywhere - it was horrendous.""In the past, high-profile celebrities and politicians were the most common targets of deepfakes - the videos weren't always porn, some were made for comedic value. But over the years that's changed - according to cybersecurity company Deeptrace, 96% of all deepfakes are non-consensual porn. Like revenge porn, deepfake pornography is what's known as image-based sexual abuse - an umbrella term which encompasses the taking, making and/or sharing of intimate images without consent.It is already an offence in Scotland to share images or videos that show another person in an intimate situation without their consent. But in other parts of the UK, it's only an offence if it can be proved that such actions were intended to cause the victim distress - a loophole which means video creators often don't face legal consequences.Government plans for a long-awaited UK-wide Online Safety Bill have been under endless revision and repeatedly shelved. The new laws would give the regulator, Ofcom, the power to take action against any website deemed to be enabling harm to UK users, no matter where they are based in the world. Earlier this month, however, Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan said she and her team were now ""working flat out"" to ensure the bill was delivered.Kate, 30, founded the #NotYourPorn campaign in 2019. A year later, her activism contributed to the adult entertainment website, Pornhub, having to take down all videos uploaded to the site by unverified users - the majority of its content.Kate therefore assumed that whoever was behind the deepfake of her had been annoyed by her campaigning. She had ""taken away their porn"". But she had no idea who that person was, or who might have seen the video. And while she could see that her face had been overlaid onto footage of a porn actor, the video was convincing enough that she worried others might not spot the deception.""It was a violation - my identity was used in a way I didn't consent to.""Underneath the video, people began leaving streams of abusive comments, saying they were going to follow Kate home, rape her, film the attack, and publish the footage on the internet. ""You start thinking about your family,"" she says, holding back tears. ""How would they feel if they saw this content?""The threat intensified when both Kate's home and work addresses were published below the video - a practice known as doxing. ""I became completely paranoid - 'Who knows my address? Is it someone I know that's done this?'""I was thinking, 'I'm really in trouble here, this isn't just some people on the internet mouthing off, there's actually a real danger.'""From her experience supporting others in similar situations, Kate knew exactly what to do if someone becomes a victim - but in that moment she froze.""I didn't follow any of my own advice,"" she says. ""Kate the campaigner was very strong and didn't show any vulnerability - and then there was me, Kate, who was really scared.""A colleague reported the video, vicious comments and doxing to Twitter, and they were all taken down from the platform. But once any deepfake has been published and shared online it's difficult to remove it from circulation entirely.""I just wanted that video off the internet,"" Kate says, ""but there was nothing I could do about it.""There's a marketplace for deepfakes in online forums. People post requests for videos to be made of their wives, neighbours and co-workers and - unfathomable as it might seem - even their mothers, daughters and cousins.Content creators respond with step-by-step instructions - what source material they'll need, advice on which filming angles work best, and price tags for the work. A deepfake content creator based in south-east England, Gorkem, spoke to the BBC anonymously. He began creating celebrity deepfakes for his own gratification - he says they allow people to ""realise their fantasies in ways that really wasn't [sic] possible before"". Later, Gorkem moved on to deepfaking women he was attracted to, including colleagues at his day job who he barely knew.Deepfake Porn: Could You Be Next?Harmless images are being turned into hardcore porn and used to harass women. Jess Davies explores the emotional and psychological toll being ""deepfaked"" has on unsuspecting victims.Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)""One was married, the other in a relationship,"" he says. ""Walking into work after having deepfaked these women - it did feel odd, but I just controlled my nerves. I can act like nothing's wrong - no-one would suspect.""Realising he could make money from what he refers to as his ""hobby"", Gorkem started taking commissions for custom deepfakes. Gathering footage from women's social media profiles provides him with plenty of source material. He says he even recently deepfaked a woman using a Zoom call recording. ""With a good amount of video, looking straight at the camera, that's good data for me. Then the algorithm can just extrapolate from that and make a good reconstruction of the face on the destination video.""He accepts ""some women"" could be psychologically harmed by being deepfaked, but seems indifferent about the potential impact of the way he is objectifying them. ""They can just say, 'It's not me - this has been faked.' They should just recognise that and get on with their day.""From a moral standpoint I don't think there's anything that would stop me,"" he says. ""If I'm going to make money from a commission I would do it, it's a no brainer."" The standard of deepfakes can vary wildly, and depends both on the expertise of the person who made the video and the sophistication of the technology used. But the man behind the largest deepfake porn website admits it's no longer easy to know for certain whether you're looking at manipulated images or not. His site attracts about 13 million visitors a month and hosts roughly 20,000 videos at any one time. He is based in the US and rarely speaks to the media - but he agreed to talk to the BBC anonymously. Deepfaking ""ordinary"" women is a red line for him, he says, but in his view,  hosting pornographic deepfake videos of celebrities, social media influencers and politicians, is justifiable. ""They're accustomed to negative media, their content is available in the mainstream. They're different to normal citizens,"" he says. ""The way I see it, they are able to deal with it in a different way - they can just brush it off. I don't really feel consent is required - it's a fantasy, it's not real.""Does he think what he's doing is wrong? Part of him is ""in denial about the impact on women"", he admits - and notably, he reveals that his spouse doesn't know what he does for a living.""I haven't told my wife. I'm afraid of how it might affect her.""Until relatively recently, deepfake software wasn't easily available, and the average person wouldn't have had the skills to make them. But now, anyone over the age of 12 can legally download dozens of apps and make convincing deepfakes in a few clicks. For Kate that's worrying and ""really scary"".""It's not the dark web, it's in the app stores - right in front of our faces."" She also fears the hoped-for Online Safety Bill won't keep up with technology. Three years ago, when the bill was first drafted, deepfake creation was seen as a professional skill in which someone would need to be trained - not merely download an app. ""We're years down the line and the contents of [the bill] are out of date - there's so much missing,"" she says.  But for creator Gorkem, criminalising deepfaking would change things. ""If I could be traced online I would stop there and probably find another hobby,"" he says.Being deepfaked and doxed had an impact on Kate's health and her ability to trust other people. She believes those behind the attacks weren't only trying to intimidate and humiliate her, but also to silence her. For a time, she stepped back from campaigning, questioning whether she could carry on speaking out about misogyny. But now, she is all the more fired-up. She realised she cared too much to walk away.""I'm not letting them win.""Deepfakes can be used to control women, and tech firms - including those who make apps that enable face-swapping - should be encouraged to put safeguards in place, she says.""Any app should be able to detect sexual content."" ""If companies have not put money, resources and time into ensuring their app isn't being used as a place to create sexual abuse content, they are being deliberately irresponsible. They are culpable.""Neither Gorkem, nor the man behind the largest deepfake website, are understood to have been involved in deepfaking Kate Isaacs.Source: #NotYourPorn Campaign",Campaigner Kate Isaacs describes the horror of seeing her face digitally edited into an adult film.,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-62821117,/news/stories
66,TikTok profits from livestreams of families begging,"Displaced families in Syrian camps are begging for donations on TikTok while the company takes up to 70% of the proceeds, a BBC investigation found.Children are livestreaming on the social media app for hours, pleading for digital gifts with a cash value.The BBC saw streams earning up to $1,000 (Â£900) an hour, but found the people in the camps received only a tiny fraction of that.TikTok said it would take prompt action against ""exploitative begging"".The company said this type of content was not allowed on its platform, and it said its commission from digital gifts was significantly less than 70%. But it declined to confirm the exact amount.Earlier this year, TikTok users saw their feeds fill with livestreams of families in Syrian camps, drawing support from some viewers and concerns about scams from others.In the camps in north-west Syria, the BBC found that the trend was being facilitated by so-called ""TikTok middlemen"", who provided families with the phones and equipment to go live.The middlemen said they worked with agencies affiliated to TikTok in China and the Middle East, who gave the families access to TikTok accounts. These agencies are part of TikTok's global strategy to recruit livestreamers and encourage users to spend more time on the app.Since the TikTok algorithm suggests content based on the geographic origin of a user's phone number, the middlemen said they prefer to use British SIM cards. They say people from the UK are the most generous gifters. Mona Ali Al-Karim and her six daughters are among the families who go live on TikTok every day, sitting on the floor of their tent for hours, repeating the few English phrases they know: ""Please like, please share, please gift.""Mona's husband was killed in an airstrike and she is using the livestreams to raise money for an operation for her daughter Sharifa, who is blind.The gifts they're asking for are virtual, but they cost the viewers real money and can be withdrawn from the app as cash. Livestream viewers send the gifts - ranging from digital roses, costing a few cents, to virtual lions costing around $500 - to reward or tip creators for content.For five months, the BBC followed 30 TikTok accounts broadcasting live from Syrian camps for displaced people and built a computer program to scrape information from them, showing that viewers were often donating digital gifts worth up to $1,000 an hour to each account.Families in the camps said they were receiving only a tiny fraction of these sums, however.With TikTok declining to say how much it takes from gifts, the BBC ran an experiment to track where the money goes.A reporter in Syria contacted one of the TikTok-affiliated agencies saying he was living in the camps. He obtained an account and went live, while BBC staff in London sent TikTok gifts worth $106 from another account.At the end of the livestream, the balance of the Syrian test account was $33. TikTok had taken 69% of the value of the gifts.TikTok influencer and ex-professional rugby player Keith Mason donated Â£300 ($330) during one family's livestream and encouraged his nearly one million followers to do the same.When told by the BBC that most of these funds were taken by the social media company, he said it was ""ridiculous"" and ""unfair"" to families in Syria. ""You've got to have some transparency. To me, that's very greedy. It's greed,"" he said.The $33 remaining from the BBC's $106 gift was reduced by a further 10% when it was withdrawn from the local money transfer shop. TikTok middlemen would take 35% of the remainder, leaving a family with just $19.Hamid, one of the TikTok middlemen in the camps, told the BBC he had sold his livestock to pay for a mobile phone, SIM card and wi-fi connection to work with families on TikTok.He now broadcasts with 12 different families, for several hours a day.Hamid said he uses TikTok to help families make a living. He pays them most of the profits, minus his running costs, he said.Like the other middlemen, Hamid said he was supported by ""live agencies"" in China, who work directly with TikTok.""They help us if we have any problems with the app. They unlock blocked accounts. We give them the name of the page, the profile picture, and they open the account,"" Hamid said.Agencies like these, known as ""livestreaming guilds"" and based all around the world, are contracted by TikTok to help content creators produce more appealing livestreams. TikTok pays them a commission according to the duration of livestreams and the value of gifts received, the agencies told the BBC. The emphasis on duration means TikTokers, including children in the Syrian camps, go live for hours at a time.Marwa Fatafta, from digital rights organisation Access Now, says these livestreams run contrary to TikTok's own policies to ""prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation"" of minors on the platform.TikTok Begging in SyriaBBC News investigates a new trend on TikTok - hundreds of families in camps for displaced people in Syria, begging for gifts on TikTok livestreams.Watch on BBC News Channel Sunday 02:30 or on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)""TikTok clearly states that users are not allowed to explicitly solicit gifts, so this is a clear violation of their own terms of services, as well as the rights of these people,"" she said.She acknowledges that people have the right to share their stories online ""to try to seek support and sympathy"", but she says these livestreams ""lack dignity, and are humiliating"".TikTok's rules say you must have 1,000 followers before you can go live, you must not directly solicit for gifts and must ""prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation"" of minors on the platform.But when the BBC used the in-app system to report 30 accounts featuring children begging, TikTok said there had been no violation of its policies in any of the cases.After the BBC contacted TikTok directly for comment, the company banned all of the accounts.It said in a statement: ""We are deeply concerned by the information and allegations brought to us by the BBC, and have taken prompt and rigorous action. ""This type of content is not allowed on our platform, and we are further strengthening our global policies around exploitative begging.""TikTok, the world's fastest-growing social media app, has made more than $6.2bn in gross revenue from in-app spending since its launch in 2017, according to analytics company Sensor Tower.The BBC approached several charities working in Syria to support families in the camps as an alternative to making money on TikTok Live.A local charity Takaful Alsham said it would provide basic supplies to the families for the next three months, helping the children find schools and covering their educational expenses.But for many in the camps, there are few options to make money other than begging online. Hundreds of families continue to go live every day, and most of the money donated is still going to TikTok.Additional research and reporting: Mohammed Abdullah, Runako Celina, Cyrus Chan, Ned Davies and Katy Ling","Children are among those pleading for hours for digital gifts, as the company takes a cut of up to 70%.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-63213567,/news/stories
67,'Claims I had sexsomnia destroyed my rape case',"Jade McCrossen-Nethercott's rape case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) because of claims she had an episode of a rare sleep condition called ""sexsomnia"". As a result, the CPS no longer believed they could secure a conviction. But Jade challenged the decision and spent months reinvestigating.The CPS now admit they were wrong not to take it to trial and have apologised unreservedly to her. But what went wrong? The BBC followed Jade's case as events unfolded.It was a Sunday evening in the spring of 2017 when Jade woke up on a sofa in south London to discover she was half-naked, with her necklace lying broken on the floor. The 24-year-old, originally from St Ives in Cornwall, had the intense feeling she had been penetrated and thought she had been raped while she slept. Three years later - and just days before the man charged with raping her was due to stand trial - lawyers from the CPS called her to an urgent meeting at a police station.Her case was being dropped. The CPS lawyer explained that two sleep experts had given their opinions on her case. They said it was possible Jade had had an episode of sexsomnia and could have appeared to have been awake and consenting. Sexsomnia is a medically-recognised sleep disorder. People with the condition perform sexual acts in their sleep.A person is deemed not to have consented to sex if they are asleep, according to the law in England and Wales. However, it also states that a person is not guilty of rape if they had ""reasonable belief"" in consent. ""It came completely out of the blue, and it was baffling,"" says Jade, who had never heard of sexsomnia until then.""I've had two long-term relationships spanning 13 years, and I've never had anything like this.""ââThe decision by the CPS meant they would close the case and the defendant would be formally acquitted.The first time Jade had been asked about her sleep, was in the police station when she went to give a formal statement.In response to a question from a police officer, she explained that she had always been a deep sleeper and had sleepwalked a couple of times as a teenager. It was a passing comment, forgotten about in the whole gruelling process until her case was dropped.  It had been Jade's best friend Bel who had dialled 999 and started the whole police process. She remembers the sound of Jade's voice on the other end of the line. ""It was like nothing I've ever heard before. She was hysterical and sobbing, and she said 'I think I've been raped.' When your best friend says that to you, it's just earth-shattering.""The two had been out the evening before at a bar in south London. They had got ready together, drinking prosecco as they did their makeup and headed out arm-in-arm. It was a fun evening, drinking and chatting. When closing time came, Bel ordered a taxi home. Jade decided to go back to a friend's flat with a few people for a last drink.At around 02:00, with people still chatting around her in the living room, she curled up under a blanket in the corner of the sofa, fully-clothed, and fell asleep.At 05:00 she says she woke up to find her trousers and pants were off and her bra was undone. She says she saw a man on the other side of the sofa she was lying on.""I confronted him saying, 'What's happened? What have you done?' And he said something a bit odd I guess, but he did say 'I thought you were awake.'""And he just bolted out basically, and left the door open. And I got my phone and started calling Belâ¦""Two male police officers arrived and took Jade straight for forensic tests. Vaginal swabs detected semen which would later be matched to the man on the sofa.The suspect offered no comment when initially questioned by police. The CPS made the decision to charge him with rape. He pleaded not guilty. A date was set for trial.But it never went ahead.Jade was determined to prove the CPS were wrong to drop her case, but she had limited time to appeal. She requested all the evidence - including police interviews, toxicology results, witness statements and the sleep experts' reports - and pored over them. She was shocked by what she read - and in particular the weight given to the sleep experts' theories. Sexsomnia: Case Closed?When unexpected sleepwalking claims turn a rape case on its head, Jade fights back. Filmed over three years, this is the remarkable story of one woman's battle for justice. Will she win?Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)Neither expert had met her in person, but their opinions had been significant enough to close her case. The first expert, who had been instructed by the defence, concluded there was a ""strong possibility"" that Jade had an attack of sexsomnia, saying ""her behaviour would have been of someone actively engaging in sexual activity with eyes open and showing pleasure"". The CPS then hired their own expert in response. He concluded that ""a history of sleepwalking, even once at the age of 16 years, and ongoing sleep talking or any family history, is entirely adequate to establish a predisposition to sexsomnia"".Jade was speechless. ""I don't see how this can be one isolated incident [of sexsomnia], that just so happens to be the time that somebody I would never have consented to have sex with had sex with me,"" she says. Jade decided to pay for her own expert opinion and approached Dr Irshaad Ebrahim at the London Sleep Centre. He also has experience of giving expert opinions in rape cases.Jade's case was the first he had seen where a complainant victim was purported to have sexsomnia. In all the other rape cases he had encountered, it was the defendant claiming to have had an attack of sexsomnia. The BBC carried out extensive research and could not find any other UK rape case where the defence had argued the complainant had sexsomnia. Dr Ebrahim explained there was limited scientific research and no precise way of diagnosing sexsomnia. But he said people he sees with the disorder are typically male and tend to have a history of the sexual behaviour in their sleep.Jade then underwent a sleep test - a polysomnography, which monitors brainwaves, breathing and movement during sleep.The test indicated that she snores and has mild sleep apnea, a common condition where breathing stops and starts during sleep. Both were, according to Dr Ebrahim, potential trigger factors for sexsomnia, so he could not rule out that she may have had an isolated episode.Jade wanted to know if he could give her a clear idea of what the chances were that sexsomnia had been to blame for what happened. ""That is the billion dollar question,"" said Dr Ebrahim. ""Wanting a definitive, black and white answer - yes it was or no it wasn't - is not going to happen.""Jade still believed she didn't have sexsomnia - but was frustrated the sleep experts couldn't rule it out. She turned to a lawyer to find out more about how courts treat the disorder as a defence. Barrister Allison Summers KC has defended in rape cases where the man accused has claimed to have sexsomnia.She told Jade that sleep experts are almost never able to say definitively whether someone has the condition - but saying ""it's possible"" could be enough for a jury to reach a not guilty verdict.  ""Do I think, as a result of that, that some guilty people get off or are acquitted? Yes, I do. But I generally come back to the point that I would rather that be the case, than we're convicting people of serious offences that are genuinely not guilty,"" she said.""The only thing I can say is that you hope the criminal trial process will enable those genuine cases to be pulled out from those less genuine.""Sexsomnia and other sleepwalking defences should always be robustly challenged in court, according to the CPS guidelines. But Jade's case never made it to court. Armed with her research, she submitted her appeal, known as a victim's right to review.A chief crown prosecutor, independent of the CPS department which made the original decision to close the case, reviewed all the evidence again.He concluded the case should have gone to trial - and that the sleep experts' opinions, and the defendant's account, should have been challenged in court.A jury would have been ""more likely than not"" to convict the defendant, he said - one of the tests a case must meet for the CPS to take it to trial.""I cannot begin to imagine what you have been through and how you feel. I noted during my review the devastating effect of this case on you,"" he wrote to Jade. ""I apologise unreservedly for this on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service although I appreciate that is likely to be of little consolation to you.""If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, help and advice can be found hereFor Jade, the acknowledgement that her case should have been put to a jury was bittersweet - because the CPS cannot reopen the case.The defendant was found officially not guilty - and so double jeopardy laws mean he cannot be tried without compelling new evidence. ""There is no hope of any justice for what happened to me,"" says Jade - but she hopes the CPS will learn lessons to prevent others from going through similar ordeals.""It's just being let down by a system that's there to protect - and they've openly said they messed up,"" she says.In the year to September 2021, just 1.3% of rape cases recorded by police in England and Wales resulted in a suspect being prosecuted, according to Home Office figures.The CPS say they are ""committed to improving every aspect of how life-changing crimes like rape are dealt with and are working closely with the police to transform how they are handled.""Jade is now suing the CPS for damages.",Jade's case failed to reach court because it was suggested she may have a rare sleep disorder.,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63116989,/news/stories
68,Only 1% of disability hate crimes result in a charge,"Of the thousands of disability hate crimes reported to the police last year, just 1% resulted in criminal charges, two charities have revealed.Leonard Cheshire and United Response submitted Freedom of Information requests to 43 police forces in England and Wales and 36 responded.It found that out of more than 11,000 reports, 99% of cases went no further.The National Police Chiefs' Council said it wanted ""to understand the reasons"" behind the low number.A hate crime is an offence which targets a victim's protected characteristics, including their race, religion, sexual orientation or disability.PhD student, Cassie Lovelock from London, told the BBC Access All podcast she has experienced physical and verbal abuse because of her disability many times.She has hereditary neuropathy with a liability for pressure palsies (HNPP), a rare condition with similar symptoms to MS, and often uses a wheelchair.On one occasion, while waiting for her boyfriend outside a shop, two drunk men grabbed her wheelchair and pushed her down the road while making sexual comments.Despite screaming for help, she claims passers-by ignored her. She eventually escaped by rolling her wheelchair into the road. On the latest episode of Access All, Cassie talks more about her experiences of disability hate crime and the team look at the support available.And a month into Prime Minister Liz Truss's premiership there's still no confirmation about who the new Minister of State for Disabled People will beâ¦or is there?On another occasion, Cassie was pushed out of her wheelchair by a woman who wanted to use the wheelchair space on a London bus for her pushchair.""It was very humiliating,"" Cassie says. The bus driver witnessed the incident, helped Cassie and refused to let the other woman travel.Cassie says the incidents she has endured - including being shouted at on the street and accused of faking her disability - have all been ""intrinsically tied"" to her disability.But, she admits, she hasn't always reported her experiences immediately because she wasn't sure they would be considered hate crimes.Ali Gunn, policy lead for United Response, which was involved in the research, says Cassie's experience is common.""A lot of the time victims don't even know they've been a victim of a disability hate crime"" and, as a result, the number of reported incidents could be the ""tip of the iceberg"".She says a disability hate crime is classed as ""any criminal offence that is motivated by a person's disability or perceived disability"".Of those hate crimes that were reported but went no further, Ali says: ""We found that around 50% of the no-charge outcomes were a result of either the victim withdrawing support, evidential difficulties despite there being a named suspect, or that the police were unable to find a suspect.""She says its ""really important for the victim to capture as much information as possible - what they hear, what they see, or what's happening and the date, the time, the location"".But she adds that the whole community should play its part. ""If you witness a crime you might feel uncomfortable or nervous to go up at the time, but afterwards please support the victim. Give your phone number, give any information that you were able to record at that point in time about what happened."" The two charities - Leonard Cheshire and United Response - which conducted the research have called for police forces to appoint Disability Liaison Officers.""They would be able to support a disabled victim from the point of reporting all the way through,"" Ali says, hopefully resulting in a higher charge rate.This week, the Home Office also released its statistics on hate crimes. It reported that 14,242 disability hate crimes had been recorded in the year ending March 2022 - an increase of 43% on the previous year. That figure has doubled since 2017/2018 with stalking and harassment offences the most commonly recorded disability hate crimes.A Home Office spokesperson described hate crime as a ""scourge on communities"" and said that ""while the rise is likely to be largely driven by improvements in police recording, we cannot be complacent.""They added: ""[We] expect the police to fully investigate these hateful attacks and make sure the cowards who commit them feel the full force of the law.""After thinking about the incident with the men, Cassie did report it to the police. She received a call from an officer and a case number, but says she never heard from them again, putting Cassie's case in the 99% that result in no charge. The force was unable to corroborate this information. Cassie is getting on with her PhD, but says the ""terrifying"" experiences have stayed with her and she has changed where she shops and which public transport she uses as a result.""Even now, I get this anxiety - what if something happens?"" she says.

69,'I refused to get out of the car unless they took me home',"An outcast from birth, Milton Washington is the child of a Korean woman and a black US soldier, who became a ""slickyboy"", or child thief, and dreamed of making it to America. At the age of eight, he seized his chance. When a beautiful car pulled up one day outside St Vincent's orphanage in South Korea, Milton Washington made a split-second decision that would change the course of his life.A black American couple stepped out. The man was in military uniform, the woman had an Afro and wore a beautiful flowing dress, and when Milton realised that they were going to adopt his friend Joseph - who was black and Korean just like him - he ran to the couple's car, jumped inside and locked all the doors. Crying and screaming for his life, he wasn't getting out unless the man and woman took him home with them too. The couple - Captain and Mrs Washington - agreed to take both Joseph and Milton home, but only to see which of them fitted in best with their family. They would give it a few days, they said, and then make their choice.That night, lying in bed in an unfamiliar bedroom, in an unfamiliar house at the Dongducheon American military base, little Milton made his second big decision of the day - and ran away. ""I didn't want to get taken back to the orphanage - maybe they wouldn't choose me,"" he says.""I was just trying to get to America.""Before his life in the orphanage, Milton was the only black child in a small village near the border with North Korea. Milton's father, an American soldier, was long gone, but his mother, who worked hard days in the rice fields, loved him and protected him fiercely against the prejudice they encountered. The children in Milton's South Korean village would sing a song about red apples, bananas, a train - and a monkey. ""I remember the part of the song they sang to me the loudest. The part about the black monkey's butt being red. That set the tone,"" he says. It was just an innocent playground song on the face of it - it wasn't racist, or at least, not designed to be. But they turned it into something hurtful: a way to single him out for the colour of his skin. As the son of a black man, he says, he fell ""outside of the limits"" of what it meant to be Korean in the '60s and '70s. And because his father was not Korean, he had no right to a birth certificate. Milton knew that his father was from the US - in his mind a land of flying cars, where the cities were made of gold, with ice-cream mountains. ""I dreamed of going to America because it was full of black people - these magical creatures,"" Milton says, ""and of being accepted.""Milton's America was a fantasy land that couldn't have been more different from his reality. He and his mother lived in a mud and stone hut, slept on the floor, and washed their clothes in the river. One morning, village elders arrived at the door and told Milton's mother they would no longer accept ""the shame that you're bringing upon this village because of that boy"". Although Milton's mother argued their case, she and Milton left their home and moved to a nearby town attached to an American military base. There were cars there, electricity, and money, all of which were new to Milton - salt had been the currency in their village. Milton also saw black American soldiers for the first time, and felt a step closer to finding his father.Milton Washington spoke to Lives Less Ordinary on BBC World ServiceIn the alleys of the red-light district below their tiny apartment, homeless boys begged, picked pockets, and fought with other gangs. The American soldiers called them ""slickyboys"" - slang for little thieves. And when six-year-old Milton shared a packet of Oreos with the boys - given to him by his mum's American boyfriend - he became a slickyboy too. Milton finally felt like he belonged. ""All the black soldiers would give me money - dollar bills, not just change,"" he says. ""It completely changed my life.""Milton's mother had become a sex worker in a club in town and went out at night to work. Milton was left alone in their apartment - under strict instruction not to leave, instructions he routinely ignored. One night Milton's mum didn't return from work as expected - the club had been raided by the police and she and all the other women who worked there were sent to jail for two weeks. Free of his mother's rules, Milton and his friends ran wild, stealing drinks from bars and having adventures all over town. When his mum returned, she made sure Milton was never left alone again. Each time she got wind of a police raid, she would drop Milton at an orphanage for a couple of weeks so that he was safe.Milton remembers being racially abused by the other, mostly Korean, kids at these orphanages, as he had been in the village growing up. But this time, he didn't let it get to him. ""I would almost laugh it off,"" he says. ""'Yeah, I may be these racial slurs that you're talking about - but you're the orphan. I have a mother, she says she's going to be back in two weeks.' And she was always back in two weeks."" For a while, this routine continued. Then one morning, Milton and his mum took a taxi to a different orphanage, where many of the children looked like Milton. It was an orphanage for children born to American servicemen and Korean mothers, called the St Vincent's home for Amerasian children.Milton's mum assured him she'd be back the following day and promised him a present - he asked for a train set. But when she returned there was no train set, just a hug that he didn't know meant goodbye. ""She told me, 'I need you to be strong,'"" he says. ""That was the last time I saw her."" It wasn't long after Milton first arrived at St Vincent's orphanage that Captain and Mrs Washington took him to their home on a military base - from where he decided to run away.He didn't get far. He was still small and the compound fences were high, and a search party found him, hours later, sound asleep in a children's playground. But the incident shook the Washingtons, who decided that both Milton and Joseph could stay with them permanently. The boys were adopted in 1977 and eventually moved to America - becoming part of a noisy, loving family of six children, who rode bikes, played sports, and went to school - all the normal childhood things Milton had longed for.But he worried about what had become of his mother and would cry himself to sleep. He was haunted by dreams of wading through paddy fields looking for her. She had always been his ""island of refuge in a very tough world"", he says.Now in his 50s - he's not sure of his exact age - Milton works as a photographer in New York and is writing a memoir called ""Slickyboy"". He's always remained curious about his biological family, and in recent years began to look for connections via DNA websites. In April 2019, he got a hit. It was a family member on his mother's side, who wanted to speak to him immediately. ""Hello, I'm calling from Seattle,"" the voice - with a strong Korean accent - said.""This is Milton-ah (little Milton),"" he said, using the name his birth mother had often called him. ""I am your sister, Tong, do you remember me?"" Milton did remember meeting Tong - she was one of his older sisters, and they had met a handful of times in Korea when Milton was a little boy. Tong had lived with their grandparents, from whom Milton's mother was estranged.Speaking to his half-sister, Milton says, was ""an incredible moment"".""I was just really excited [to be] connected with my past, and to have my memories validated by her.""Milton had not expected his mother to survive, but Tong told him she'd lived a long life, and had died just a few years previously. His mother and sisters had come to the US in 1998, and though they knew that Milton was living there too, Milton's mum had felt she had no right to contact him. But she had left a keepsake for Milton with Tong - a gold and jade necklace to remember her by. ""It's a beautiful piece,"" he says. ""It's a way to carry my mother with me."" Milton keeps searching for answers about his father. He believes his dad likely came from Louisiana, but has little more information.""I want to know what kind of man he is. He's the only missing link,"" Milton says. Despite the sadness he still sometimes feels, Milton is certain his mum made the right decision giving him up all those years ago. ""She knew that if I had a shot at an American life, I would do well at it. I love her for that act,"" he says. ""There is a hole in my heart that's always going to be there. But the benefits of my current life versus what it could have been - there's no argument there.""","South Korean orphan Milton dreamed of making it to America, the land of his father. One day he seized his chance.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62786001,/news/stories
70,"Anne Hegerty: ‘Quizzing is easy, daily life is difficult'","Anne Hegerty is best known as her ruthless television alter-ego, The Governess, who regularly puts wannabe-quiz champions firmly in their place on The Chase. But the former journalist, who was diagnosed with autism later in life, reveals that while quizzing comes easily to her, she finds everyday tasks extremely difficult.Every morning the chaser pours herself a large cup of coffee and sits down to complete 25 quizzes. She says it's ""the easiest part"" of her day. ""After that I do the difficult stuff, like going upstairs and having a shower and getting dry. And then putting some clothes on and making sure they are clean, and then actually getting myself out of the house.""All of that is hard work,"" she told the BBC Access All podcast. ""It feels like a I've climbed a mountain.""Hegerty, 64, found a love for knowledge early on in life.""I was a nerdy child and I discovered that I could learn things off by heart,"" she says of the skill she hasn't lost.""This morning I was trying to get back to sleep, so I decided to reel off American presidents working backwards. And by the time I got to Lincoln, I thoughtâ¦I obviously don't want to sleep and I just got up.""Hegerty turned that skill into a profession when she joined the hit ITV quiz show The Chase in 2010 as The Governess, in a role which sees her alternately intimidate, deride and occasionally flirt with contestants to put them off their game.Her 12-year stint on the show led her to appearing on the 2018 season of I'm A Celebrityâ¦ Get Me Out Of Here, Brain of Britain, Mastermind and the Australian version of The Chase.But she has faced huge challenges behind the gloss of her TV career.Hegerty was diagnosed with autism aged 45, after she watched a TV programme about the developmental disability and recognised some of the traits in herself. She experiences sensory issues and struggles with loud noises when she's tired or stressed. Daily chores take huge amounts of energy for her to complete and when she is feeling particularly stressed, she has to follow instructions which break down household tasks, step-by-step, like sorting out her washing.""It'll say 'go upstairs, take washing bag, put on floor, sort out tights, put in this container, sort out hot wash, put in that container, take bag downstairs, put tights in washing machine'.""I have to just write it all out. I need a lot of time to kind of get all my neurons lined up and pointed at something before I do it,"" she says.Before joining The Chase, Hegerty says she was ""really struggling"" having lost her job as a copy editor and proof-reader after two decades. ""I was good at the proofreading, but I was not good at actually getting the thing finished, parcelling it up and sending out an invoice,"" she says.Her ""low point"" hit in 2008. Hegerty was behind on rent, unopened bills littered her hallway and the bailiffs turned up.On the latest episode of Access All, listen to Anne talk more about life as The Governess, being diagnosed with autism in her forties and her theory about why bailiffs are like vampires...Plus BBC News correspondent, Sean Dilley, describes the heartbreak he's going through having retired his guide dog, Sammy, after 10 years together.Fortuitously, around this time, an employee from her housing association also visited and realised Hegerty needed help. ""She told me, 'don't worry, we'll fix this',"" Hegerty recounts. ""She got me a social worker, a lovely bloke called Jeff.""Jeff helped Hegerty access funding from her utilities provider to help pay her bills as well as applying for other benefits including Jobseeker's Allowance and Disability Living Allowance.""It just gave me a breathing space where I could work out what was going on,"" she says.Hegerty's love for knowledge hadn't abated and it was around a year later she discovered the UK's high-level quizzing circuit.She turned up to her first quiz in Liverpool as an unknown. The BBC happened to be auditioning quizzers for the second series of Are You An Egghead? and Hegerty gave it a go. She filmed the episode and ended up coming third.""At the time I didn't realize what a tiny, incestuous world quizzing is,"" she laughs. ""Soon enough everybody in quizzing knew I'd done really well. They were like: 'Who is this new woman?'""Hegerty went on to the British leg of the Quizzing World Championships, where a chance encounter with a fellow quiz aficionado made an impact.""He told me that he had just finished making the pilot series of a new show called The Chase, and he said 'you should watch it, it's going to be really good'.""That tip-off came from Mark ""The Beast"" Labbett, who has been on every season of The Chase since its inception. When the chance to audition for its second season popped up, Hegerty went for it - and the rest is history.Looking back, Hegerty says she is glad she sought out her autism diagnosis because it gave her chance to reflect on how her brain works. It also gave her insight into how neurotypical people behave, including those she quizzes against. ""I look back and there are things that I resented at the time but I now think, 'actually, they were trying to be nice',"" she says. ""Everyone's just trying to figure it out.""You can listen to the podcast and find information and support on the Access All page.","The Governess, Anne Hegerty, on autism and how she finds everyday household tasks difficult.",https://www.bbc.com/news/disability-63089051,/news/stories
71,I went undercover to expose abuse at mental health unit,"A vulnerable young woman is locked on the other side of a thick glass window, crying like I have never heard anyone cry before.For hours I have been sitting outside the small room, listening to her desperate pleas to be let out. This is the image that haunts me from the three months I spent working undercover for BBC Panorama as a healthcare support worker.I went in to investigate whistleblower allegations about staff behaviour and patient safety at the Edenfield Centre in Prestwich, near Manchester - one of the UK's biggest mental health hospitals. It could be a frightening place for patients and staff. Walking through the hospital doors for the first time wired up with a secret camera, steadying my hand, swallowing my heartbeat, I thought I would surely be discovered. But I wasn't.I had spent months preparing for this, role playing with care specialists. Training arranged by the BBC left me confident I could give basic care to vulnerable patients and defuse potentially violent situations.But the hospital did not know this.Instead, before starting work, Greater Manchester Mental Health - the NHS trust which runs Edenfield - gave me a one-day online induction.Then I was out on the ward floor, looking after patients for up to 12 hours a day. I was paid Â£9.51 an hour, less than some supermarkets might pay me to stack shelves.Undercover Hospital: Patients at RiskA BBC Panorama undercover investigation has found evidence that a secure NHS psychiatric hospital is failing to protect some of its vulnerable patients.Available now on BBC iPlayer(UK Only)Edenfield is a medium secure psychiatric unit; a step down from better-known high-security hospitals like Broadmoor and Rampton. Patients here are detained under the Mental Health Act because there is a serious risk they could harm themselves or others.In practice, this can mean extremely vulnerable and sensitive patients can find themselves living alongside a convicted murderer, perhaps recently transferred from prison with mental health issues. They live together in a highly restrictive environment and are expected to get on with each other. The use of seclusion rooms was the first of many shocks I encountered. It's a difficult thing to comprehend for someone like me, who had never set foot in a mental health hospital before starting this investigation.Picture a small, square bedroom, a few metres wall to wall. Now strip away the carpets, wardrobes, drawers, mirrors, light fittings and picture frames. You cannot open the window and someone watches you 24 hours a day, while you sleep and even when you go to the bathroom. You cannot leave this room until someone else decides you are fit to.Seclusion is only supposed to be used in extreme cases, for the shortest time necessary, to prevent people harming others. But staff told me one woman had been confined like this for more than a year. I spent hour after hour tasked with observing patients locked in these rooms. Some of them left a huge impression on me. I had perfectly normal conversations with articulate, funny and fiercely intelligent young people who have strong ambitions and desires to better their lives. But instead, these patients are locked away in the formative years of their lives. Not only that, they also told me that Edenfield was actually making them worse. Out on the ward, it can sometimes feel like a prison. The jangle of keys, the heavy locks on every door can all make you forget you are in a hospital.A hospital where I expected to see psychotherapists and psychiatrists, but for much of the time they were nowhere to be seen. Support workers like me spent the most time with patients.Most of them spent their days vaping and watching music videos. It could be an excruciatingly mundane existence.Staff told me managers were not present on the wards enough to understand the reality on the ground. A support worker on one ward described a ward as a ""dangerous shit show"". Another said the hospital was ""going to the dogs"".In this absence of senior leadership and managers, a bizarre dynamic evolved. Staff behaviour was strange - sometimes juvenile, sometimes actively cruel.Staff told me they passed night shifts play-fighting with glitter bombs. One morning, I saw senior support workers playing football in an outdoor area, leaving a ward of sleeping patients unattended. And I witnessed staff sleeping on shift.At the same time, the language used in front of patients and away from the ward floor could be horrifying at times. Olivia, 22, told me she was teased and sworn at ""all the time"". She told me the hospital had made her worse in ""every way"", and I can understand why. She said staff swore at her in the most explicit terms, and called her ""fat"". I heard staff laughing at her when she was distressed - behind her back - and a nurse refusing to go and see her.  On the surface, she can seem no different to any other 22-year-old girl, but she has a history of self-harm and has repeatedly tried to end her life. She's not the only female patient I worked with. Harley, a 23-year-old woman with autism, was spoken about throughout the hospital as if she was a kind of monster. Most staff showed little compassion or understanding about her complex needs. She would sometimes shout, and I was told she had been aggressive towards staff, but she said she was reacting to being provoked.I found Harley to be highly articulate with a clear understanding of the life she was missing. She knows she is not getting what she needs and was determined not to be broken.  I was in the room when managers agreed she should be restrained and forcibly placed in seclusion. I saw her dragged from a mattress on the floor and pinned to the ground face down, screaming. It was chilling. I had to leave the room and get on with the rest of the day, but it caught up with me on the drive to my flat. I pulled over in a supermarket car park and broke down, hands shaking, tears streaming down my face. Nothing has ever upset me more. Many of the patients feel like they've slipped through the cracks. It is an unnerving thought that almost anyone could end up somewhere like Edenfield.For many patients, it felt like they were stuck in a holding pen, often without much hope of being released. I didn't see many getting better and I saw very little therapy to help their recovery.  So, what happens now? I hope the evidence I gathered can lead to real changes in patient care. These patients have the right to be treated with dignity and with humanity. And to be properly heard. Yet it feels to me like some of them have been almost entirely forgotten by the world.I will certainly never forget them.Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust said it was taking the allegations very seriously and had put in place immediate actions to protect patient safety. A number of staff members have been suspended, and the trust is working with police, healthcare regulator the Care Quality Commission and NHS England. Senior doctors have reviewed the patients involved and an independent clinical review of services at Edenfield has been commissioned by the trust. It said: ""We owe it to our patients, their families and carers, the public and our staff that these allegations are fully investigated to ensure we provide the best care, every day, for all the communities we serve.""Greater Manchester Police said it has opened a criminal investigation.",Alan Haslam spent three months on the wards - what he calls a frightening place for patients and staff.,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63061077,/news/stories
72,'Why I made chicken biryani when my grandson was born',"The first generation who came to post-war Britain from the Indian subcontinent arrived with as little as Â£3 in their pockets - all the money they could bring in under strict currency controls. Their descendants, in their millions, are part of the make-up of contemporary Britain, but many of their stories are still to be told - and they reveal so much about the process of migration. Mohammed Ajeeb arrived in Britain in 1957 from Pakistan with a battered suitcase. His first home was in Nottingham with 28 other men from Mirpur, in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. He'd had a clerical job in Pakistan but could only find work in a factory. ""I cried at night in my bed,"" he confesses. ""I wanted to go back but I didn't want to be seen as a failure. I thought, 'I'm a determined young man, I want to succeed by hook or crook in this country,' and that carried me."" Over the years, he fought many battles for equal pay and against racism - but he stayed and went on to become the mayor of Bradford. The 1948 British Nationality Act meant people who came from the former colonies or the empire automatically became British citizens. Britain needed workers to rebuild the country after World War Two. Many who came in the early years from the Indian subcontinent were single, young men. They mostly worked the difficult shifts in the factories, foundries, and textile mills in places like Birmingham, Bradford, and West London. These men thought they were coming for only a few years: they never imagined generations of their family would one day live here. Gnawing loneliness, and missing family, was part of life for these pioneers, the so-called Â£3 generation. Many wrote to their family on blue aerogram letters. Gunwant Grewal came over from Ludhiana, Punjab in 1965. Life wasn't what she had imagined. She had been a teacher in India, but could only find factory work when she arrived. She lived in a room in Southall, west London, with her husband and daughter in a shared house, a far cry from her spacious home in India. She desperately missed her father who she wrote to regularly.  ""My tears were on my letter as I was writing. My father said, 'Why was your letter damp?' and I said, 'Oh I was having a cup of tea,' when really it was tears. But slowly, slowly it got better."" One time walking past a bus stop, she saw an elderly Sikh man who reminded her of her father. She spontaneously hugged him. A phone call to hear a loved one's voice was out of the question. Ravi Patel arrived in 1967 with Â£1, having spent the rest on the journey over to Britain. He recalls that phoning India cost Â£1.40 per minute, a vast sum then. So Ravi called his family in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, twice a year: once on Diwali and once on his father's birthday. It remained that way until the early 2000s, when communications were revolutionised by companies like Lebara, which was started by three British-Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and offered cheap telephone calling cards. You could now phone the Indian subcontinent for as cheaply as one penny a minute. Decades after Ravi left India, he could now speak to his best friend whenever he wanted.When I started interviewing these pioneers nearly a decade ago, their experiences were not widely documented, but in recent years there has been a growing interest in the stories of people who came from the former empire and made their once colonial ruler home. And the struggles of that generation for equality and against racism are now better known.Each generation has a different attachment to the place left and the place where they now live - but these private, and sometimes delicate, tussles between parents and children are rarely recorded. I have been reporting on the ups and downs of the relationship between Farah Sayeed and her mother Runi, who came in 1968 as a young bride from Dhaka, East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. Farah was born a year later. Runi's generation often bore and raised their children alone, without the support of their own mothers or any wider family. For the next generation, it was different. In late 2001, Farah was in Liverpool when she called her mother in London to tell her she was about to give birth. Runi says, ""I started to shiver and scream because I'm her mother and I should be near."" She jumped into the car and drove to Liverpool. She arrived to be told her grandchild had been born. ""That was the happiest moment of my life,"" Runi smiles, ""I am eternal now.""Waiting in the hospital corridor to see them jogged a memory. She remembered giving birth to Farah and writing a letter to her mother in then East Pakistan, saying she now realised what being a mum meant. Runi recalled lying in the hospital bed with her newborn, in pain, and how she missed her mother who was so far away. She was hungry and wanted to be comforted by her mother's food. So when, decades later, she walked into Farah's room and met her grandson, she remembered that hunger and ache for her own mother. She asked Farah what she wanted to eat. Chicken biryani, she replied. Runi searched Liverpool's halal shops and made that dish for her daughter.Three Pounds in My Pocket Series 5 starts on Friday 8 April at 11:00 BST on BBC Radio 4. You can hear the previous series on BBC Sounds Farah, after giving birth to her son, had her own revelation. ""Within seconds of becoming a mum, I had a completely different appreciation of what my mum must have gone through. She didn't have any real extended family around, compared to how supported I felt.""Five years later, in 2006, Farah had another child and decided to return to London, to be near her mother. She had left the family home in 1988 wanting to get away from the burden of her parents' expectations, with a yearning to live her own life, her way. In deciding to come back to be near her parents, she wanted to give her children something she never had - grandparents. Hers had lived in Bangladesh and she barely saw them. Hearing Farah, I realised that there must be many thousands from the second generation, born in Britain, who grew up orphaned from their grandparents. This relationship between our children and their grandparents - the pioneers - has such a precious meaning for us, as it was something we never had.For Farah, life had come full circle. She wanted her children to be immersed in Bengali food, culture and language - things that were so much a part of her parents' home. It was the same home Farah had wanted to escape in the late 1980s. ""When you're young, you want to fit in, and when you're older, you're just confident - fitting in matters less than the things that made you who you are.""Testimonies like these are an important part of the story of migration and the story of Britain. What began as an empire ended up with former subjects of the Raj settling as citizens, with generations now living here. Each individual making a choice about what to discard from the place left behind and what to hold on to in Britain.Runi's husband died last year. Her voice breaks as she tells me, ""It feels like you build a house and you start with one brick. I built the whole big house over the years with him. We fought, we argued. But we wanted to build that house, and we did.""He is buried near their home in London. As a young man, he wanted to rest in Bangladesh's earth, in the family plot there. But later, he realised his home was where his children and grandchildren were. His centre of gravity had shifted. There had been many difficult and lonely times, but now three generations were successfully established in Britain. Runi tells me she has reserved a plot next to his. ""I feel that this is a big tree, solidly rooted into a land, and it cannot be pulled out.""",,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60988410,/news/stories
73,How a guitarist saved hundreds on a sinking cruise ship,"When the luxury liner Oceanos started taking on water in rough seas during a voyage around the coast of South Africa in 1991, musician Moss Hills and his colleagues suddenly found themselves responsible for everyone on board.  It was during dinner that Moss Hills began to realise just how severe the storm was. The ship's waiters, normally completely adept at carrying drinks and food without spilling anything, were struggling. Moss, a guitarist from Zimbabwe working on board the cruise liner alongside his wife Tracy, a bass player, had never seen the waiters dropping trays before.   Earlier that day, gale-force winds and heavy rains had delayed sailing for the final leg of the cruise towards Durban several times. But with no sign of conditions improving, the captain eventually decided to lift anchor and the Oceanos, with 581 guests and crew on board, sailed off into 40-knot winds and 9m-high (30ft) waves. Moss and Tracy, both in their 30s, would usually host parties up on the pool deck as the ship sailed away from port. But that day the party had been moved indoors, and Moss braced his body while he played his guitar, trying to keep his balance as the ship pitched and rolled.""The storm just got worse and worse,"" Moss says. At dinner, Tracy - who her husband describes as unflappable - decided to go to their cabin to organise an emergency bag, just in case.""Off she went,"" Moss says, ""and suddenly - boom - all the lights went out."" When none of the ship's officers appeared to issue instructions, Moss, who was not easily frightened, began to feel uneasy.""You're on a ship in the middle of the ocean, in the dark of night, in a terrible storm,"" he says, ""I felt this tightening in my stomach.""When small, dim emergency lights came on, Moss went up to the lounge to check on the musical instruments on stage. Microphone and cymbal stands were strewn about. Then he suddenly realised he couldn't hear the constant, throbbing, background noise of the engines. The ship had lost power and was slowing down. Soon the 153m (502ft) Oceanos was drifting sideways onto the crashing waves.The ship, says Moss, was getting hammered.Anxious guests began pouring into the lounge. Pot plants, ashtrays, and chairs were sliding around, and people had to move from their seats to sit on the floor as the ship lurched wildly from one side to the other, port to starboard.About an hour passed, and the mood in the lounge grew tense. Moss grabbed an acoustic guitar and began singing with some of the other entertainers to try to keep people calm. But as time stretched on, Moss noticed that the ship was heeling - no longer coming back to a level position when it was being thrown about in the storm. ""Something bad is happening,"" Moss said to Tracy, ""I'm going to try and find out what's going on.""Hear Moss tell his story in a new series of Life Changing on 6 April 2022 at 0900 on BBC Radio 4 - or listen to the podcast. More from Life Changing:Hanging on to the handrails, Moss and another entertainer, Julian, a magician from Yorkshire, made their way through the darkness below deck. They could hear excited voices speaking many different languages. Officers were running around, some were carrying bags, some had life jackets on, and some were wet. ""Everyone was pretty wild-eyed and panicked-looking,"" Moss says. ""We were trying to ask, 'What's happening?' but it was like we didn't exist.""Julian and Moss continued down to the engine room - the lowest part of the ship.""We were way below the waterline, in the dark, on our own, and there was no-one there,"" Moss says. ""That would never, ever happen, even when you're docked.""The thick, metal doors which acted as a safety barrier by preventing water moving from one compartment of a ship to another in the event of flooding, were tightly closed.""But it sounded like there was a large body of water sloshing about behind those watertight doors,"" Moss says.The Oceanos was sinking. Back up in the lounge, there had still not been any announcements about what was going on. Moss found the cruise director who said the captain had told her they were going to have to abandon the ship. ""Then we found out that one lifeboat had already gone with a lot of the crew and senior officers on it,"" he says.Moss and the others had no idea how to evacuate a cruise ship, nor how to launch the lifeboats which hung high above the deck along each of the ship's sides, but there was nobody more qualified around to do it.One by one, they began lowering the starboard side lifeboats down to the deck. They didn't know how to keep them steady as people got on, so Moss improvised by standing with one leg on the deck of the ship and the other on a lifeboat. But each time the ship rolled to starboard, Moss would have to jump back onto the Oceanos before the lifeboat swung away, opening up a gap of a couple of metres, and then swung back, smashing with such force against the ship's hull that bits of it came splintering off.Each heaving lifeboat, now with as many as 90 people in it, many screaming in fear, would then be lowered down to the sea on cables. But Moss had no idea how to start the engines or even where the keys were.""We'd let them go, off into the night, and they would just drift away into the pounding waves,"" he says. ""The people in the lifeboats had a torturous time - they were getting deluged in spray, it was cold and completely dark, but we just had to carry on until all of the starboard side lifeboats were launched.""By now the Oceanos was taking in more and more water and heeling markedly to its starboard side. Launching the remaining lifeboats on the port side safely was near impossible.Instead of being lowered down to the water once loaded up with people, the lifeboats would cling to the side of the ship until the next big wave rolled in, tipping the ship enough to let them dangle freely.""And then gravity would suddenly drop the lifeboat three or four metres (13 ft) in one go, almost tipping people out into the open water, it was horrific,"" Moss says.Eventually, he realised it was too dangerous to continue.  ""In the effort to try and rescue people we were possibly going to kill them,"" Moss says.And time was running out.Unable to launch any more lifeboats, but with hundreds of people still in need of rescue, Moss and others made their way up to the ship's bridge - where they assumed they would find the captain and the remaining senior officers - to ask what to do next.""We looked inside, but there was no one there,"" Moss says. ""That's when we realised - it's just us.""Orangey-red lights blinked in the darkness, but Moss had no idea what most of the equipment was for, never mind how it worked. They took turns trying to use the radio to send an SOS.  ""I was calling, 'Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!' and just waiting for somebody to answer,"" Moss says.A big, deep, rich voice eventually replied. ""Yes, what is your Mayday?""Relieved, Moss explained that he was on the cruise ship Oceanos and that it was sinking.""OK. How long have you got left to float?""""I don't know - we've got the starboard railings in the water, we're rolling around, we've taken on a huge amount of water,"" Moss said. ""We still have at least 200 people on board.""""OK. What is your position?""""We're probably about halfway between the port of East London and Durban.""""No, no, no, what are your coordinates?""Moss had no idea what their coordinates were.""What rank are you?""""Well, I'm not a rank - I'm a guitarist.""A moment's silence.""What are you doing on the bridge?""""Well, there's nobody else here.""""Who's on the bridge with you?""""So I said, 'It's me, my wife - the bass player, we've got a magician hereâ¦'""Moss was put in contact with two small ships that were close to the Oceanos. They told Moss to find the captain and get him onto the bridge. But Moss had no idea where he was.""I knew he wouldn't be down below because we were sinking,"" he says. ""I was making regular checks to see where the water level was, and one deck below us was flooded.""Eventually, Moss found the captain, right at the back of the ship, smoking in the darkness. Moss explained that they needed his help - urgently.""He was just looking at me, wide-eyed and vacant, saying, 'It's not necessary, it's not necessary,'"" Moss says.""I think he was in deep, deep shock.""The two ships close to the Oceanos had only one lifeboat each, so there was little they could do to help. They shared the sinking vessel's coordinates with the South African authorities who began to organise an air rescue mission. As the storm continued to batter the ship, Moss and Tracy sat together in the near darkness, praying that help would arrive before it was too late. ""I think the ship is going to go down and it's very likely we're going to go down with it,"" Moss said to his wife.He and Tracy had a 15-year-old daughter, Amber, who'd been on board the Oceanos for the holidays and disembarked just days earlier. Amber was now back at boarding school in South Africa.""She can't lose both parents,"" Moss remembers saying. ""Whatever we do, we've got to make sure at least one of us gets off.""More than three hours passed before the first rescue helicopter arrived and hovered above the ship. Two navy divers were winched down to the Oceanos' deck. They said they needed help to get everyone off before the ship sank, and Moss was given a five-minute crash course on how to run a helicopter airlift.""Remember, the harness needs to be quite tight under people's underarms,"" the navy diver told him. ""Make sure you get it right because otherwise they'll tip upside down and fall out - you'll kill them on the deck. Do two at a time or else we're going to run out of time. OK? Go.""One navy diver went to organise the helicopter rescue at the rear of the ship and Tracy and Moss were to organise a second at the front. But as the ship sank ever lower beneath the waves, people began jumping off the steeply pitching deck in panic and a rigid inflatable had to be launched into the churning sea to rescue them. Dangling in mid-air from the helicopter cable, people who Moss was trying to save were being blown against parts of the ship by the strong winds as they were winched into the sky. There was no way of knowing how badly hurt they were and Moss momentarily lost his nerve. But with so many people still on board, he realised he had no choice but to keep going.In total, five helicopters joined the rescue mission, shuttling back and forth, carrying 12 people at a time to safety as dawn broke and the darkness lifted. Drained and exhausted, Moss and Tracy were among the last to be strapped into harnesses.""As we were hovering above the ship it really hit me,"" Moss says, ""I could see the Oceanos was in a critical situation. We could see waves breaking over the bow where we had been rescuing people.""When the helicopter carrying Moss touched down on the grass, cruise passengers ran towards him singing and cheering, and reaching out to hug him.""I started to choke up and sob,"" Moss says, ""and then I collapsed.""On 4 August 1991, about 45 minutes after the last person on board had been airlifted to safety, the Oceanos slipped away below the water. Everyone who had been put into lifeboats was rescued by passing ships and remarkably no lives were lost. Moss and Tracy, who now live in Liverpool, continued working as cruise ship entertainers for many years. Even now, three decades later, Tracy prefers not to talk about the sinking or dwell on how close they all came to losing their lives. But Moss, who's been asked about the Oceanos many, many times, finds it cathartic to talk about. He looks back on what happened with great relief.""I'm not invincible,"" Moss says, ""but if I can get through that, I can get through anything.""There was an inquiry in Greece which found the captain of the Oceanos and four other senior officers negligent in the ship's sinking.All images courtesy of Moss Hills, unless otherwise stated.Listen to Moss Hills on Life Changing - producer Thomas Harding AssinderDo you have an extraordinary story to tell?

74,UK farmers call for toxic weedkiller ban,"Some British farmers are calling for a ban on the UK production of toxic weedkiller Paraquat, saying studies suggest it could be a factor in the onset of Parkinson's Disease. It comes as hundreds of US farm workers pursue a legal case against its manufacturer, alleging it knew the risk and failed to warn them.  Andy Pollard was once a farm manager who could leap into his tractor cab. But now his limbs are rigid and his body contorts with spasms. He has advanced Parkinson's Disease, and can no longer control his own movements. He spent decades spraying herbicides on his land and, unaware of any danger, didn't use protective equipment. ""Paraquat was a really good thing to use - or so we thought,"" his wife Sue says. ""Andy would be driving around the fields and the spray would be going everywhere.""She had thought it was a coincidence that the only people she knew with Parkinson's were farm workers, then read about the potential connection with the chemical.""Why hasn't it been regulated and stopped?"" she asks. ""We've got a lot of people in the same situation.""Paraquat was first manufactured in the UK in the early 1960s and is sold globally - 377 companies have registered it for sale.It is one of the world's most popular and effective herbicides, millions of farmers have used it to kill weeds. But it is also one of the most dangerous and has caused thousands of poisoning deaths. Its manufacturer Syngenta says claims of a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's are not supported by scientific evidence, stating it has undergone more than 1,200 safety studies.Andy regularly visits a Dorset farm run by charity Countrymen UK, founded by Julie Plumley after her father John was diagnosed with Parkinson's.The 30-acre working farm sells beef and lamb. In the yard, instead of tractors is a fleet of mobility scooters. ""The farmers come here not because they're ill,"" Julie explains, ""but because they want to get on with living.""Parkinson's Disease is believed to be the world's fastest-growing neurological condition. It affects neurons in a specific area of the brain called the substantia nigra. It is degenerative, gradually leading to tremors and stiffness in the limbs. Global studies show rural, agricultural areas often have higher rates of the disease.Julie explains her childhood farm was owned by the local council, so her father had to meet certain conditions. ""He had to use chemicals, because if you got too many dock leaves or thistles, they could take money away from you. Paraquat was the pesticide all the farmers used.""He would carry a backpack filled with the chemical and spend hours hand-spraying the fields. ""He would have his sleeves rolled up, his arms bare, the liquid dripping down.""John developed the disease in his 40s and always believed there was a connection to the chemicals. His suspicion deepened when his neighbour Ken Barnes was diagnosed around the same time - he was also in his 40s and had also been using Paraquat for years. Ken now visits Julie's farm. He has a twinkle in his eye, but his clarity of speech has gone. ""It's a horrible disease,"" says his wife Sue. ""It's taken his life away.""She says its manufacture in the UK and export should be stopped. ""I wouldn't want my son, who's got farming qualifications, ending up like his father.""Paraquat has not been authorised for use in the EU since a court ruling in 2007. That is still the case in the UK after Brexit but it is still made - under the brand name Gramoxone - at Syngenta's plant in Huddersfield. It is exported to countries such as the US, Japan and Australia, with a fifth of exports going to the developing world.In the US, nearly 900 farmers and field workers have joined forces to sue the manufacturer, claiming not only is there a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's, but that Syngenta has deliberately hidden the health risks from the authorities. Syngenta rejects the claims made in the remaining multidistrict litigation case, which is due to come to court later this year.The company's most recent financial statement shows that the company has already paid $187.5m into a settlement fund. But it said the company believes that all of these claims are without merit and the payment is simply to keep the claims from going any further.Toxicologist Prof Jon Heylings worked for Syngenta and its predecessor companies for more than 20 years. After retiring, he turned whistleblower, and has given evidence as an expert witness in the US legal action. He said farmers who used it without protective equipment, damaging their skin, should be worried. ""If they went out the next day and actually used it again, and the next day, you could absorb more Paraquat through the skin, into the blood and then into the brain,"" he says.""The issue is really does it actually cause Parkinson's when it gets into the brain? That's one of the key issues around the whole exposure. And if this chemical does cause Parkinson's, who is responsible?"" There is no scientific consensus and many conflicting studies on any possible association between Paraquat and Parkinson's.In the UK, research charity Cure Parkinson's said exposure was ""a well-recognised environmental risk factor"" but Parkinson's UK said studies show ""a small increased risk"" at most.In the US, a 17-year-long study found Paraquat contributed to Parkinson's onset and progression. And research by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences - part of the US Department of Health - found people who used Paraquat developed Parkinson's two-and-a-half times more often than non-users.But the US regulator, the Environmental Protection Agency, says an updated study couldn't replicate those results and no clear link was found.But there are scientists who believe Syngenta is putting profit before product safety and public health.Prof Heylings has a Syngenta regulatory strategy document from 2003 written while Paraquat was still being used by UK farmers. Its author acknowledges a growing number of studies ""citing a correlation between incidence of Parkinson's Disease and herbicide use, including Paraquat"".He explains: ""Syngenta are trying to influence researchers who are working on Paraquat and also influence the direction of the research because the last thing Syngenta wants is a big blow up on Parkinson's. So the strategy was to downplay anything to do with the potential neurotoxicity of Paraquat that could lead to Parkinson's."" It said: ""In our view, Jon Heylings is technically not qualified to comment on Paraquat and Parkinson's Disease. He is certainly not aware of Syngenta's research on the issue, which was mostly conducted from 2008 onwards, after he left the company. We spent tens of millions of dollars investigating Paraquat and Parkinson's disease - and this figure doesn't include the monetary value of internal expert time.""In a statement, Syngenta said it had invested hundreds of millions of dollars over the product lifetime to ensure its safety.""Paraquat has been the subject of more than 1,200 safety studies submitted to, and reviewed by, regulatory authorities around the world. Recent thorough reviews performed by the most advanced and science-based regulatory authorities including the United States and Australia continue to support the view that Paraquat is safe.""Photos by Claire MarshallSee the full story on Countryfile on BBC1 at 17:30 BST on 3 April and afterwards on the iPlayer.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-60836892,/news/stories
75,How the Falklands conflict shaped my identity,"On Friday 2 April 1982, Argentina invaded the British overseas territory of the Falkland Islands. It had claimed sovereignty over the islands for many years. The country's ruling military junta did not believe that Britain would attempt to regain the islands by force.The ruling military junta was wrong. Britain, under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, assembled warships, refitted merchant ships and sent a task force 8,000 miles (12,900 km) across the globe to the South Atlantic.Over the next 10 weeks, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders were killed.Forty years on, Tamsin McLeod, an islander who grew up in the shadow of the conflict and now lives in London, tells the BBC what her homeland means to her - and how the island families coped with their peaceful lives being thrust into the arena of war.""Our nickname is 'Kelper' because of all the seaweed and kelp surrounding the islands, so I'm a Kelper or Falklander first and British second, and on the islands we are so, so eternally grateful for what the British did. I probably wouldn't be here today if that task force had not been sent. ""My parents didn't really talk about it to me much as I grew up.""It was something that happened, where you have the Liberation Day and the parades and the receptions, and you attend them and everything. And it's very personal. ""But the older I've become the more my parents have opened up about it. My parents would say in passing, 'oh, yeah, your aunt and uncle were locked in the Goose Green town hall for 30 days'."" During the war more than 100 islanders were held at gunpoint and imprisoned in the community hall at Goose Green. They had been summoned to a meeting there by Argentine officials. They were kept at the hall, in appalling conditions, for nearly a month.In just two months of hostilities in the Falklands, 891 men died, 132 aircraft were lost, and 11 ships were sunk.""It was always there. It's always in the background. It's the legacy of the conflict - especially with the landmines. It was completely normal to be surrounded by bits of land you couldn't go on, fenced off because there were landmines and if you step on one you could die. ""So going on a walk, it was like, 'oh, yeah, here's wreckage from a helicopter or something from the war'.""When the invasion happened, my mum was completing her O-levels. Imagine these being interrupted for three months, because you're being occupied and you're being told you have to learn everything in Spanish. ""All of a sudden, you have to drive on the opposite side of the road, you've got a curfew. ""My mum really, really vividly remembers Argentine soldiers turning up at her doorstep because my granddad was the local butcher at the time, and they were like, 'you need to kill mutton and feed us'. ""And my granddad - he was born in England, he vaguely remembers the Second World War, and he did his national service before moving to the islands. And so he's like, 'I'm not putting my family at risk'. So he shipped his whole family out to Horseshoe Bay, which is another farming settlement in the middle of nowhere. ""And that's my mum's main experience of the war - her dad being genuinely fearful."" Margaret Thatcher addressed the House of Commons on 3 April:""We are here because for the first time for many years British sovereign territory has been invaded by a foreign power. ""After several days of rising tension in our relations with Argentina, that country's armed forces attacked the Falklands yesterday and established military control of the islands â¦ By late afternoon yesterday it became clear that an Argentine invasion had taken place and that the lawful British government of the islands had been usurped.""There is not a shred of justification and not a scrap of legality to the invasion. The Falkland Islands and their dependencies remain British territory - no aggression and no invasion can alter that simple fact. ""It is the government's objective to see that the islands are freed from occupation and are returned to British administration at the earliest possible moment."" ""My dad is slightly older. He turned 18 in April during the conflict, he and his brother were helping feed and cook for the British soldiers. They gave their car, their motorbike, the jeep. People stayed on their floor. They were trying to do as much as they could. ""My dad was a young man at that time and there were people his age dying, soldiers dying.""You couldn't really escape it. But then in a positive way, you appreciate how lucky you are, how privileged you are. To call yourself a Falkland Islander, to be six generations to grow up here, to have a childhood surrounded by penguins and beaches, to have insanely good fresh air.""""The way I grew up, it was 'appreciate what you've got, because we could have really not had this'.""When I came to the UK, people knew nothing about the Falklands, genuinely nothing. Especially people my age. ""Occasionally some mention penguins - and sometimes you meet a friend's parents in their 40s or 50s and they remember the conflict.""It's like, 'I remember hearing about it on the radio or seeing it on the television. Wasn't there a war in the 80s? Wasn't Margaret Thatcher involved?'""That's all they knew.""""I grew up there, it's my home. So it was completely normal. I didn't know anything different until I moved away and then went, 'oh, hang on a second, there's a whole wide world here'.""There's still such a strong, strong feeling. My parents are still really close with lots of veterans. They're genuinely family friends.""My godmother lost her son on the Sir Galahad. She came to the Falklands to see where he lost his life. And it's terrible, terrible circumstances. I don't think a mother should ever have to do that. And she stayed with my family and returned to the island several times since that original visit. ""And because of that relationship, she became a really important part of my life.""On 8 June, while preparing to unload soldiers from the Welsh Guards in Port Pleasant, RFA Sir Galahad was attacked by the Argentine Air Force, each carrying three Mk 82 500lb (227kg) bombs. Sir Galahad was hit by two or three bombs, which exploded and started fires. The explosions and subsequent fire caused the deaths of 48 crew and soldiers.""People should care about the war. People lost their lives. ""We are very resilient. We fight for what we believe in and we really want to continue to fight to be British.""The island has moved on from the war. We have made the most of the sacrifices lost. We still remember the past and we appreciate everything that's happened. But we're looking to the future now.""We do not have a positive relationship with Argentina at all. It's not civil at all. ""We are not just statistics and geography - we have heritage, we have history, we have lived experiences that are very valuable to us. ""We're becoming the gateway to Antarctica on that entire side of the world, which is amazing. We're the scientific hub of the South Atlantic. We have more than 60 different nationalities, including a growing population from Zimbabwe due to the de-miners coming and removing the landmines, so we are really cosmopolitan. And we're really proud of that. ""I probably will go back. It's home. It's where my family are. I love going home and visiting them and seeing friends. It's a lot slower. ""That soil is my home. So I carry a piece of it with me wherever I go. My necklace has Falklands sand in it and I promise you, it does not come off. Ever. ""The Falklands are a part of me and I'm a part of them.""Tamsin's story is taken from My Moment in History - a BBC Local Radio podcast focusing on people whose lives have been affected by the Falklands War.Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

76,Mariah Carey officially not 'Queen of Christmas',"Mariah Carey's application to trademark the moniker ""Queen of Christmas"" has been denied by the US Patent and Trademark Office.The American star's application was denied after her company did not respond to another singer's opposition.The trademark would have given her the legal right to stop others from using the title on music and merchandise.Carey also failed in attempts to trademark the abbreviation ""QOC "" and ""Princess Christmas"".The star has become synonymous with the festive period since the release of her 1994 track, All I Want for Christmas Is You.Completing a journey 26 years in the making, the ubiquitous festive classic finally reached number one in the UK singles chart in 2020.Carey's company Lotion LLC applied for the yuletide trademark last year, leading to another singer, Elizabeth Chan, putting in a legal challenge in August, in an attempt to block her from obtaining the registration.Chan - dubbed ""Queen of Christmas"" by The New Yorker in 2018, for having put out original festive records every year for a decade - criticised Carey for attempting to monetise Christmas.""I feel very strongly that no one person should hold onto anything around Christmas or monopolise it in the way that Mariah seeks to in perpetuity,"" said Chan in an interview with Variety in August.""That's just not the right thing to do. Christmas is for everyone. It's meant to be shared; it's not meant to be owned.""Chan went on to say Carey had been ""trying to trademark this in every imaginable way"" from music, clothing and alcohol, to ""masks, dog collars - it's all over the map"".""If you knit a 'Queen of Christmas' sweater, you should be able to sell it on Etsy to somebody else so they can buy it for their grandma,"" she went on. ""It's crazy - it would have that breadth of registration.""Carey's company did not respond to Chan's opposition in time so the trademark was not granted, meaning knitters around the world can continue without fear of breaching Christmas copyright.The BBC has asked Carey's team for a comment.Another singer, Darlene Love, previously took to Facebook to say she had been ""Queen of Christmas"" since before Carey rose to fame.Love is known for her Christmas classic Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) and covers of hits such as Winter Wonderland and White Christmas.Earlier this month, it transpired that Carey was no longer being sued for copyright infringement over her own Christmas hit, after country singer Andy Stone dropped his legal action.The songwriter - who performs under the name Vince Vance with the band Vince Vance and the Valiants - sued the popstar in June, claiming he co-wrote a song with the same name five years earlier. He told a court he would dismiss the case - but legally he could still refile it.Christmas came early for Carey last week, when Netflix treated her to a special early screening of series five of The Crown at her home as a reward for being the show's ""ultimate superfan"".",The US star's application to trademark the moniker has been denied for administration reasons.,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-63647164,/news/entertainment_and_arts
77,"Hancock in jungle prompts 1,100 Ofcom complaints","Ofcom has received 1,100 complaints about former health secretary Matt Hancock appearing on the ITV show I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!There has been widespread criticism of Hancock for appearing on the show while he is a serving MP.Hancock has said he hopes to raise awareness of his dyslexia campaign while in the Australian jungle.Ofcom will now assess all complaints before deciding whether to investigate. The broadcast regulator received just under 2,000 complaints about the show in total.While more than half of those were complaints about Hancock's involvement, some of the others were from viewers expressing concerns about how he was being treated by his campmates.In a blog post on its website, Ofcom wrote: ""It's worth being aware that under our rules, in principle - and taking into account freedom of expression - there's no ban on any particular person taking part in programmes. ""However, if the mere presence of a person is likely to cause offence, we would expect broadcasters to take steps to mitigate or justify that offence. How they do that editorially, is up to them.""Hancock was suspended from the Conservative parliamentary party after it emerged he was taking part in the show.The 44-year-old was forced to resign as health secretary in June 2021 after he kissed a colleague while the government's social distancing guidelines were in place.Many questions remain about the decisions made during the Covid crisis by Hancock and other government ministers - and whether more lives could have been saved. An inquiry scrutinising the handling of the pandemic has been launched, which Hancock has supported and is co-operating with.On Tuesday, campaigners including Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice flew a banner over the Australian jungle, where the I'm A Celebrity campmates are stationed, demanding Hancock be removed from the show.Parliament's watchdog has also received dozens of complaints about his participation.A petition set up before the series began demanding that ITV pull him from the show has over 45,000 signatures.Hancock has given a robust defence of his decision to take part in the popular ITV programme, both before entering the jungle and when in discussions with his fellow campmates.He said he was going into the jungle to raise awareness of dyslexia, telling the Sun that politicians must ""go where the people are"". He has also said he will donate some of his fee for the programme to a hospice in his constituency of West Suffolk and dyslexia charities.But he has faced criticism on social media for not mentioning dyslexia when asked by camp mates why he had entered the jungle, although the show is heavily edited.During the show, he has told the other celebrities that there was ""no excuse"" for the actions that led to his resignation, adding: ""Look, I know how people felt.

78,MrBeast overtakes PewDiePie as top YouTuber,"MrBeast has ended PewDiePie's reign as the YouTuber with the most subscribers - the first change at the top in almost 10 years.Swedish creator PewDiePie, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, became the most-subscribed YouTuber in August 2013 with his gaming reaction videos.In 2019, he was the first person to attract 100 million subscribers.But the philanthropy of MrBeast, really called Jimmy Donaldson, gained him his 112 millionth subscriber this month.Although YouTube does not show the exact numbers, that pushed him above PewDiePie's 111 million.MrBeast is known for videos featuring huge cash giveaways and prizes, as well as charity work.In 2021, he launched a separate philanthropy-themed YouTube channel, which itself has more than 10 million subscribers, and he has a licensed charity that functions as a food bank to feed communities across the US.He and fellow YouTuber Mark Rober organised international collaborative fundraisers TeamSeas and TeamTrees, which focus on environmental issues - the latter raising more than $24m (Â£16.7m) to plant 20 million trees worldwide.And PewDiePie himself donated almost $70,000 to the TeamTrees project.British YouTuber Steven Bridges, whose videos have millions of views on the platform, told the BBC MrBeast has ""mastered the skill"" of making compelling content.""There's probably no other YouTuber in the world who understands it as well as MrBeast,"" he said. ""Making an entertaining video is one thing, but ensuring that every single second of a video keeps the viewer hooked is very difficult to pull off, and MrBeast's retention - the percent of the video the average viewer watches - and view counts speak for themselves.""Really, MrBeast is playing the game of making the most entertaining videos that appeal to the biggest number of people, and he's consistently knocking it out of the park. ""I don't think there's any YouTuber out there that's surprised MrBeast has taken the number one spot.""Though neither has yet commented on the milestone, PewDiePie previously said he thought MrBeast would ""definitely"" overtake him.""I can't wait for it to be over,"" he joked in a video from August 2022. ""He definitely deserves it. I hope he does it.""And while MrBeast has become the most-subscribed individual user on YouTube, he is some way off having the biggest YouTube channel. T-Series, an Indian music video publishing company, leads the way in that category with more than 200 million subscribers.Despite their apparent rivalry for the top YouTuber crown, MrBeast publicly supported PewDiePie when the music video channel rose to prominence.In 2018, PewDiePie had the top YouTube channel altogether, and became embroiled in a - mostly jokey - public rivalry with T-Series over the top spot.MrBeast was the first prominent YouTuber to make videos supporting PewDiePie, buying radio adverts and billboards in North Carolina urging people to subscribe to him.Over the course of a year, PewDiePie eventually lost the top channel spot to T-Series, although he went from about 60 million to 90 million subscribers in the contest, making his lead as top YouTuber apparently unassailable.That has ultimately proved not to be the case.","PewDiePie's almost 10 years of dominance have come to an end, as MrBeast reaches 112 million subscribers.",https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63635382,/news/entertainment_and_arts
79,Beyoncé and Adele dominate Grammy nominations,"BeyoncÃ© and Adele are the stars to beat at the 2023 Grammy Awards, and will go head-to-head for all the major prizes.Both artists have been nominated for album of the year - Adele for her sumptuous fourth album 30, and BeyoncÃ© for her dancefloor opus Renaissance.Adele's single Easy On Me and BeyoncÃ©'s Break My Soul are each up for song and record of the year.British stars Harry Styles and Coldplay are also in the running for best album, alongside Swedish pop icons Abba.The quartet have received their first ever album of the year nomination for last year's Voyage - which saw them emerge from a 39-year hibernation.The nominations were announced on Tuesday, and BeyoncÃ© leads the pack with nine overall - including nods in the dance and R&B categories.She is now tied with her husband Jay-Z as the most-nominated artist in Grammy history, with a total of 88, overtaking Sir Paul McCartney and Quincy Jones.However, the star has not won a prize in any of the three biggest categories (album, record and song of the year) since Single Ladies was named song of the year in 2010.But if she collects four (or more) awards next February, she will beat conductor Sir George Solti's all-time record of 31 Grammys.Kendrick Lamar is this year's second biggest nominee, with eight nods for his fourth album Mr Morale and the Big Steppers - a pensive rumination on the state of the world and his own moral failings - and the freestyle The Heart Part 5.Adele and country star Brandi Carli are tied in third place, with seven nominations each.Taylor Swift has received multiple nominations for her epic re-recording of 2012's All Too Well, but her latest album, Midnights, was released too late for inclusion in the 2023 field.And Puerto Rican rapper and singer Bad Bunny has made history by landing the first ever album of the year nomination for a Spanish language album.His record, Un Verano Sin Ti (A Summer Without You), dominated the US Billboard charts this summer, racking up 13 weeks at number one.British artists have had a particularly strong year. Along with Adele, Harry Styles has nominations for album of the year (Harry's House) as well as record and song of the year (As It Was). Ozzy Osbourne picks up several nominations in the rock categories for his solo record Patient Number 9; while the Isle Of Wight duo Wet Leg get a nod for best new act.Drake and The Weeknd, who would have been likely frontrunners in the main categories, withdrew their latest albums from consideration. Both artists have long maintained, with some justification, that the Grammys sideline black artists to genre-based categories.Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, whose side project Silk Sonic also declined to submit their album. Rather than criticise the voters, however, Mars said it ""would be crazy to ask for anything more"" after winning song and record of the year for Leave The Door Open at this year's ceremony.Last month, the rapper Nicki Minaj protested that her hit song Super Freaky Girl had been moved from rap to the pop categories during the shortlisting process. In the end, it failed to pick up any nominations.Other snubs included Elton John, whose hit collaboration with Dua Lipa, Cold Heart, was expected to pick up a nomination for best pop duo/group performance; and Ed Sheeran, whose fifth album = was completely overlooked.But the Grammys can be strangely cautious of mainstream success. At this year's ceremony, for example, Jon Batiste won album of the year for the handsome soul record We Are, beating big sellers like Olivia Rodrigo's Sour and Lil Nas X's Montero. His victory reinforced the perception that Grammy voters care more about tradition and musical chops than innovation and commercial performance - something many former nominees have grumbled about. However, that could change this year, after almost 2,000 new members joined the voting organisation, 44% of whom come ""from traditionally underrepresented communities,"" according to the Recording Academy. ""And almost 50% are under the age of 40,"" noted chief executive, Harvey Mason Jr.The nominees were announced in a livestream from the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles by former winners including Olivia Rodrigo, Cyndi Lauper and John Legend.Here's a rundown of the major categories, and who might stand to win at the ceremony on 5 February, 2023.The headline here is the repeat of 2017's best album race, in which Adele's 25 controversially beat BeyoncÃ©'s Lemonade. On stage, Adele said: ""I can't possibly accept this award. I'm very humbled and very grateful and gracious but my life is BeyoncÃ©."" In the end, she held on to the trophy - but when it arrived in the mail it was broken in two. That's symbolism.So who will take top honours this time? BeyoncÃ©'s Renaissance is undoubtedly the better album - a bold blast of dancefloor catharsis, which champions the black and queer roots of house music. But Grammy voters often play it safe, choosing ""traditional"" songcraft over innovation. The academy's membership has been revamped since the upset of 2017, potentially tipping the balance in BeyoncÃ©'s favour. But Adele has won all 13 Grammys she's been nominated for since 2012.This is Taylor Swift's sixth song of the year nomination - meaning she now ties with Sir Paul McCartney and Lionel Richie as the category's most-nominated writer. The recognition comes for All To Well, a break-up ballad that originally appeared on her 2012 album Red, but was re-recorded with extra verses (and extra juicy details) last year.However, Swift has never won best song - and her competition this year is especially tough. Adele's comeback Easy On Me is the presumed frontrunner: A big blustery ballad, it sold more in the US than her previous song of the year winner, Hello, and spent 10 weeks at number one.Harry Styles can beat that, though. As It Was, a pop song whose nimble melody disguises lyrics about loneliness and doubt, enjoyed 15 weeks atop the US charts earlier this year. While the song of the year award recognises music and lyrics, record of the year looks at the finished product - the actual sound recording. However, there's significant crossover between the categories, with Adele, BeyoncÃ©, Lizzo and Styles all picking up duplicate nominations.Once again, Adele leads the pack, but Lizzo's outrageously charismatic About Damn Time could be a contender.Meanwhile, Swedish pop legends Abba gained a surprise nomination for Don't Shut Me Down, taken from their comeback album Voyage. The sumptuously-recorded vocals alone could be enough to earn them a Grammy award - which would be the band's first.Most years provide a breakout star whose victory in the best new artist category seems nailed on. Last year it was Olivia Rodrigo. This year, it's an entirely open field.Predicted nominations for rapper Jack Harlow and singer-songwriter Gayle failed to materialise, despite nominations in other categories.As a result, the smart money is on Atlanta rapper Latto, thanks to her breakout hit Big Energy, for which she bagged a guest appearance from music legend Mariah Carey. Meanwhile, former Eurovision winners Maneskin have made huge inroads in the US, and British indie duo Wet Leg are building a sizeable audience for quirky hits like Chaise Longue and Ur Mum.There's also a big opportunity for Brazilian star Anitta - who has had a breakthrough year in the States, after releasing her fifth album, Versions Of Me, in April.While her decade-long career might seem grounds for disqualification, the criteria for best new artist are fairly relaxed. Artists are eligible if they have broken into public consciousness over the past 12 months, even if they've received prior Grammy nominations.Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

80,Stormzy: The 'token black act' trope needs to die,"Stormzy has said he has made a conscious decision to promote his black peers and predecessors, to combat prejudice in the music industry.""I've always understood I'm the black act. Maybe the token black act,"" the superstar British rapper told DJ Trevor Nelson in a one-off BBC special.""I want to kill that where it stands.""That's why, the star explained, he paused his historic Glastonbury Festival set to read a list of 52 rappers who influenced him.It also prompted him to populate the video for his recent single, Mel Made Me Do It, with musicians Little Simz, Dave and Gabrielle; sports legends Usain Bolt, Ian Wright and Dina Asher-Smith; and the author Malorie Blackman.""There's always been this stigma of, 'let one through',"" he said. ""There's one black [man], one black woman at a time. That needs to die. ""So that's why when I get Glasto, when I do Mel Made Me Do It, it's like, 'This is us... We stand on your shoulders.' ""I didn't just pop out of the blue and break the matrix.""Stormzy is also supporting new generations of black talent through his Merky foundation, which offers scholarships to Cambridge University; and Merky FC, which aims to improve diversity among football managers, coaches and other behind-the-scenes roles.The 45-minute BBC special saw Stormzy perform a mix of classic hits and new songs, and sit down for a candid interview with Nelson about his origins, his rise to fame and why headlining Glastonbury had calmed his inner demons.""It gave me such a peace in terms of knowing, all right, if it all falls [apart], you've done it. Now you can walk with your head high.""The musician said the performance had given him the confidence to pursue a more soulful, spiritual direction on his new album This Is What I Mean.He cited Stevie Wonder, Frank Ocean and Lauryn Hill among the record's influences - but reserved his highest praise for Whitney Houston, who he named the ""greatest of all time"".""I've got a lot of GOATs, but Whitney is my GOAT GOAT,"" he said.""If I leave here and I get in my car and I listen to Whitney, I'm thinking, you've done something that's intangible.""You haven't put your hand on my back, you haven't shaken my hand, you haven't given me a hug - but you have just hit me in my soul.""Stormzy also talked about his long-standing friendship with fellow Londoner Adele. ""I'm a genuine fan,"" he told Nelson. ""She's blessed with a gift of a stunning, beautiful, moving voice and a phenomenal pen. And her ability to marry what she's gone through, her experiences, her feelings, with art and melody, is second to none.""However, he said he had never considered asking her to appear on one of his records.""Our friendship ain't based off [that]. That's never the conversation. ""Anyone who does music that is my real-life friend... Adele, Ed [Sheeran], Dave, Chris Martin, it's never off that basis. I'll be fine to never make music with any of them. ""However, if I could get a hook...!"" he joked, before adding: ""But no, I never, I never.""","The rapper wants to promote his peers and predecessors, to combat prejudice in the music industry.",https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-63638704,/news/entertainment_and_arts
81,Wagatha play won't 'punch down' at Rooney and Vardy,"""The Wagatha Christie case has mystery, suspense and broken friendships - all the ingredients for a great drama,"" says Liv Hennessy, whose West End play is based on the High Court clash.Love it or hate it, the dispute between Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney captured many headlines earlier this year.It arguably offered light relief to audiences weary of hearing about war in Ukraine, Covid, the heatwave and politics.""Wagatha felt like a real water-cooler moment in the UK, which I think is quite rare now,"" says playwright Hennessy, a former story producer for ITV soap opera Emmerdale.The trial was dubbed ""Wagatha Christie"" - a reference to both women as footballers' wives and girlfriends (Wags), and Agatha Christie, the author famous for her whodunit mysteries.Following her 2019 Instagram sting operation, Mrs Rooney dramatically accused Mrs Vardy, on social media, of leaking private stories about her to the Sun.Mrs Vardy has always denied this, and filed legal proceedings against Mrs Rooney - but in July, Mrs Justice Steyn ruled Mrs Rooney's accusation was ""substantially true"". Mrs Rooney is expected to receive an estimated Â£1.5m from Mrs Vardy towards legal costs.Hennessy says her play, Vardy v Rooney: The Wagatha Christie Trial, captures a moment in time - exploring what is private and what public.""This case couldn't have happened 10 years ago, and it probably won't happen in 10 years, because media law is catching up with how we operate on social media every day,"" she says.""The play questions what we ask of our public figures, and whether we believe they should behave with integrity - which is fair enough if you're a politician, somebody very high up. ""But it becomes murkier when you're a social-media influencer, or you're 'fame adjacent', but you have social media.""When you start to monetise public trust, and get money for your Instagram posts, we sort of have a right to know whether we can trust you or not.""Before putting pen to paper, Hennessy spent a fortnight wading through 1,200 pages of transcripts, bought by the play's producers. This wasn't a hardship though - she had already been ""glued to the case"", following it via WhatsApp groups and Twitter and taking particular delight at some of the memes.""I come from soap, so I'm used to very, very tight deadlines, working under extreme pressure and finding the story,"" Hennessy says.""It suited my skill set - but it's been a ride.""She also consulted people with the necessary legal knowledge, ""to make sure I nailed it"".The play is a piece of verbatim theatre - when its characters speak, they use real-life words.  Director Lisa Spirling, who approached Hennessy to write the play, knew the format could work.""Nicholas Kent did a huge amount of plays based on trials [and inquiries] at London's Tricycle Theatre, so we knew it had been done before"", she says.His work includes plays on the Grenfell Tower fire, Stephen Lawrence's murder and Bloody Sunday.Both women are clear about what struck them about the Vardy-Rooney trial - and what they chose to avoid.Hennessy stresses she is not trying to belittle the women, arguably best-known for being footballers' wives.""You could think we're punching down at people who don't understand the legal system, we're going to laugh at them,"" she says. ""That's not what this play is about.""Instead, what really came across reading the transcripts was ""they both are incredibly intelligent women, who navigate a legal system - most of us would be very confused"", Hennessy says.""They're so self-possessed, they're confident, they handle it,"" she says.Spirling admits being initially ""quite snobby"" about the case, until the play's producer, London Theatre Society president Eleanor Lloyd, persuaded her to think again and explore the issues raised. She agreed, and realised it had huge potential as a play. And she is not alone in this - Channel 4 is also making a docudrama about the case.""I was asking, 'Are we pulling down two working-class women, or two women in a situation who happen to be very rich?"" Spirling says, on how the women could be portrayed. But her ""hackles went up"" at the ""patriarchy of everyone calling them Wags the whole time"".Former sports journalist Alison Kervin, who landed a three-book deal in the 2000s to write novels starring Wags, told the Times recently: ""I hate the term Wag.""The whole 'Wag' culture infantilised women,"" she said. ""They were seen as the pretty hangers-on.""Girls no longer want to be just wives or girlfriends. As we've seen this summer, women are able to play football too - and actually win.""Spirling also found a connection with the case.""I'm from Lancashire originally, and many of my (male) friends are professional footballers,"" she says. ""A bizarre amount were from my local school.""To see those boys go on that journey and have too much money, be too famous too young, and what that does to you - to be living that life, as those guys have for 20 years -the exhaustion of that, and how you maintain it, and for the women alongside it. ""So I just I felt like I knew that world.""And after a ""deep dive into what people were fighting for"" in the court case, she concluded ""it's reputation and control of their narrative... Instagram is a way of individuals taking back control"".One voice missing from the trial was that of Caroline Watt, Mrs Vardy's friend and agent.A consultant forensic psychiatrist produced a report concluding she was unfit to give oral evidence.But she is featured in the play.""What Liv has done extraordinarily well is to find a way to bring Caroline into the room,"" Spirling says. ""So you have a sense of her, partly because of so many WhatsApp messages, but also in the presence of that person. ""She's the one we're not talking about, where you go, 'That is someone that's lost their job, who wasn't in the public eye, who clearly this has been incredibly distressing for, and significant and troubling... it feels really important."" Hennessey also includes football pundits on stage, who comment on the action in court, plus action replays. She won't divulge which memorable moments from the court case are featured but says: ""I don't think people will be disappointed.""The production started out as a one-night-only performance but has been extended after demand for tickets.""We want to give people a great night out,"" Spirling says. ""The world is pretty tough right now. ""This play absolutely has conversations about economics and fame and celebrity - and it will give people a bit of escapism.""Vardy v Rooney: The Wagatha Christie Trial is at London's Wyndham's Theatre on 15, 22 and 29 November, 6, 13 and 20 December and 10 January.

82,The Bollywood actress caught up in a 'gifts scandal',"A court in India has granted bail to Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez in a case of money laundering.The 37-year-old actress is being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the Indian government agency that investigates financial crimes. It has accused her of financial misdemeanour and wants her in custody. Fernandez' lawyer Prashant Patil denies the charges and insists there is no legal case against her.The case has made headlines in India because of the celebrity status of Fernandez.A Sri Lankan beauty pageant winner and model, she debuted in Bollywood in 2009 and has established herself as a popular actress.Film critics often trash her acting abilities, but Fernandez has been paired with some of the industry's biggest stars, including Saif Ali Khan, Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan, and starred in some hits.She has participated in stage shows in India and abroad alongside superstars Shah Rukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra and worked as a judge on a popular dance reality show.A celebrity endorser for several big brands, the actress is routinely found in media lists of ""most desirable"" women, ""the world's sexiest Asian women"" and the ""most popular Indian celebrities"".But since last year, she has been embroiled in an unseemly controversy involving an alleged conman, details of expensive gifts she's received from him, and accusations of money laundering against her. ED officials have called her for questioning on several occasions, filed charges against her in court and were pitching to arrest her. But on Tuesday, a Delhi court ruled in her favour and allowed her bail. The case centres around her relationship with Sukesh Chandrasekhar - a 32-year-old man accused of extortion by several people and described by the authorities and Indian press as a ""conman"". According to court documents, Chandrashekhar, who's been in prison since 2018 in connection with other cases, was named in a fresh complaint in August last year where he was accused of extorting a business family of 2bn rupees ($24.6m; Â£20.9m) in 2020. His lawyer Ashok K Singh has denied all the charges against his client and said that ""he has been framed"".While investigating this case, officials say they found that between February and August last year, Chandrasekhar had lavished Jaqueline Fernandez with gifts worth 71.2m rupees which included designer handbags, clothes, jewellery, a horse, cars for her siblings and parents, properties and cash payments.Fernandez does not deny the gifts but Mr Patil, her lawyer, says that she is also ""a victim"" of an elaborate crime.According to court papers, Chandrashekhar first approached Fernandez in December 2020 through Pinky Irani - a woman who was arrested a year after that for her connections with the alleged conman and freed on bail later - but the actress did not show any interest in him then.She first spoke to him at the end of January 2021 after her staff received a call from what they believed was the Indian home ministry saying that the actress should speak to Chandrashekhar as he was an important official. Investigators say this was a ""spoof call"" which showed Chandrashekhar's number as belonging to the home ministry. Fernandez says he told her that he was the scion of a top political family from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, that he owned a well-known news TV channel and a big jewellery firm and that he was interested in producing a project for a streaming service with her as the lead.She met him twice in the southern city of Chennai when he was out on parole to attend his uncle's funeral.Mr Patil insists that Fernandez had no idea that he was in jail because he was on video calls with her all the time - prisoners do not have unfettered access to phones - and had sent her videos of himself travelling in private jets.Mr Patil denies that Fernandez was dating Chandrasekhar. ""This was the stage before that, he was chasing her and was calling her parents and siblings and buying them expensive presents in a bid to impress them. She was considering him.""According to court documents, he had gifted her a diamond ring from Tiffany with their initials inscribed on it and proposed to her.In January, after intimate photographs of the couple went viral on social media, Fernandez posted on Instagram, appealing to her fans, friends and media to not intrude into her personal space. Officials say that Fernandez knew early on in the relationship who Chandrasekhar was because her staff had sent her articles about his alleged criminal activities on 12 February last year.But the actress says she believed Ms Irani's explanation - that ""she had known Chandrasekhar for 13 years, that he was from a very good family and the press articles were fake news promoted by his political rivals"" - and re-established contact with him a few days later. She says she broke off with him in August last year after she saw news of him being re-arrested by police while in jail.But officials say that she ""conveniently overlooked his alleged criminal past and continued to accept presents from him which means that she was receiving proceeds of crime"".They also accuse her of withholding information, misleading them and deleting messages from her phone that could have been used as evidence in the case.Mr Patil says Fernandez deleted the messages she had shared with Chandrasekhar ""because you can understand the trauma she went through when she discovered that he was a conman"".""These were private communications of a celebrity and there were pictures that she didn't want people to see. You can't go after her personal photographs. You have to protect the dignity of a woman."" Fernandez is ""a victim of lies just like the others that Mr Chandrasekhar is alleged to have conned"", Mr Patil says, adding that accusations of money laundering or that she took proceeds of crime are unlikely to stick against his client. ""The Supreme Court says that knowledge of crime is key. But Jacqueline wasn't aware of Chandrasekhar's involvement in any crime. Maybe you can question her and say what she did was morally wrong, but can you says it's legally wrong?""The case has no merit. I think she would get justice from the court,"" he adds.

83,Michelle Obama: Being kind to myself is a challenge,"Michelle Obama has admitted she struggles with negative thoughts about her appearance and her ""fearful mind"", but that women need to ""learn to love ourselves as we are"".In her new book, the former US first lady reveals she ""hates how I look all the time and no matter what"".But she has found strategies to be kind to herself, she told BBC Breakfast.She said: ""I'm still a work in progress and facing myself each morning with something kind is still a challenge.""She continued: ""I try every day to, as I say in the book, greet myself with a positive message. ""And it's really a shame that so many of us, particularly women, have a hard time just looking at our own image and not tearing it apart and figuring out what's wrong.""I think that's at the core of some of our unease and unhappiness, because if we don't start out by learning to love ourselves as we are, it's hard to pass that on to others. ""So I am working on it every single day.""Mrs Obama, 58, was in the White House with husband Barack between 2009 and 2017.In the only UK interview for her book The Light We Carry, BBC Breakfast's Naga Munchetty told her: ""You are seen as a powerhouse. ""You are seen as this confident woman, this established woman, this smart woman... If you're feeling like this, what hope do the rest of us have?""Mrs Obama replied: ""I think that's the point of sharing it. ""We all have those thoughts, those negative thoughts that we've lived with for years, especially as women and as women of colour, where we don't see ourselves reflected in our society.""I think we're in a better position, but one of the things I talked about was what it was like growing up, not just as a black woman, but as a tall black woman, before the Serena and Venus [Williams] years, before we had the WNBA [Women's National Basketball Association] and had role models other than gymnasts to look up to.""It is important for us to see who we can be in order to feel good about ourselves.""She also spoke about the importance of dealing with the ""fear that naturally arises in all of us"".""If you can master your fear, if you can become comfortably afraid - be afraid of the things that can actually cause you danger, but be open to the things that can push you forward - there's real powerful growth on the other side of that feeling of fear.""I can say now that everything that I am today is the result of me pushing past my comfort zone, quieting my fearful mind and taking on that challenge that might have otherwise held me back.""In the book, Mrs Obama reveals that the most anxious she has been in her life was when her husband told her he wanted to run for president. ""It's strange to think I could have altered the course of history with my fear,"" she writes.She told BBC Breakfast it was ""absolutely worth taking that leap of faith"" and giving him her support. ""I lived through the legacy of too many people, particularly African American people, my grandfathers included, whose lives were constricted by their fear of something different,"" she explained.Her grandparents grew up at a time when ""there were real fears that a black man showing up in the wrong neighbourhood, at the wrong time, in the wrong place, looking the wrong way, could mean his death"", she said.""So with each passing year, I feel like my grandfathers' world got smaller and smaller and smaller, both of them, to the point where they didn't trust anyone that they didn't know, not even doctors. And that, with one of my grandparents, led him to miss a diagnosis of lung cancer.""I use that as an example of how so many of us are locked in our sameness, afraid to meet or understand anyone that doesn't look like us, feel like us, agree with us. That keeps our world small and it makes us susceptible to disinformation, conspiracy theories that we are confronted with.""We start to fear anyone who's not like us. That's not a healthy place. So I want young people in particular to think about that jolt of fear when they're confronted with it, to be able to distinguish between the fear that's going to keep them safe, and the fear that's going to keep them stuck in a small world.""She added that more and more people ""feel like they don't matter on this planet"", and that it ""still hurts"" that Donald Trump took over from Barack Obama.""That's that point in time when you have to ask yourself, was it worth it?"" she said. ""Did we make a dent? Did it matter? And when I'm in my darkest moment, my most irrational place, I could say, well, maybe not. Maybe we weren't good enough.""But then I look around, and when there is more clarity, when I'm able to unpack those feelings and think more rationally, I think, well, my gosh, there's a whole world of young people who are thinking differently about themselves because of the work that we've done.""Did everything get fixed in the eight years that we were there? Absolutely not. That's not how change happens. But we laid a marker in the sand. We pushed the wheel forward a bit. But progress isn't about a steady climb upward. There are ups and downs and stagnation. That's the nature of change.""And that's why the work that we're doing today is about empowering the next generation.""The couple now run the Obama Foundation, whose mission is to ""inspire, empower and connect people to change their world"".",,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-63595322,/news/entertainment_and_arts

It was in fact the British Broadcasting Company and was made up of  separate stations around the country operated by different companies. London 2LO was run by the Marconi company. Manchester's station was operated by Metropolitan-Vickers. However, in these early days few records were kept of what was broadcast.But new research on the BBC's very early days has been carried out by Steve Arnold, a self-confessed Radio Times obsessive.His tricky task was to try to piece together the BBC's schedules before the Radio Times - so named as it listed the times that the new medium's shows were being broadcast - was first published in September 1923.He explained he found information in ""gossip columns [in regional newspapers] mainly, people saying we listened to this last night and this is the only record of some of these things"".Now, using sources from archive documents and newspapers, Steve has begun to piece together a picture of what the early BBC was doing. He says the Manchester station, which operated out of Trafford Park, seems to have been the best organised.""It looks as though the Manchester station is probably the origins of the BBC as much as the Marconi 2LO station (in London),"" he said.""They seem to have had a far more professional approach. There's a lot more documentation and it seems they knew their onions. I'd love to know more.""The record of Manchester's pioneering children's programme reveals that on 15 November 1922, Miss A Bennie, known as The Lady of the Magic Carpet, read The Happy Prince by Oscar Wilde. One excited listener wrote: ""I first clapped the phones to my ears, a recitation was in progress, and then a voice announced 'Now, children, listen to this lovely fairy story'.""Algy's Priceless Piffle, featuring Victor Smythe, was a pioneer of radio satire and again, came from Manchester.Manchester also broadcast, according to the Liverpool Echo, the first variety acts on 24 November 1922, two months before 2LO's first official variety programme, Veterans of Variety.The importance of the BBC in Manchester also lay in how far it reached. At the beginning it could only be heard in an area around 25 miles from Trafford Park. However, over the next few years the signal was relayed to other transmitters in Liverpool (6LV), Leeds/Bradford (2LS), Hull (6KH), Nottingham (5NG) and Stoke-on-Trent (6ST).Other services covering the UK were also set up in the months after the first broadcast in November 1922. In Glasgow, 5SC opened on 6 March 1923 and broadcast excerpts of an opera.  Cardiff's 5WA broadcast the first full performance of a new orchestral opera on 30 May 1923.  The BBC has been celebrating its centenary over the past month with a series of events and special programmes, which launched on 18 October - as that was the 100th anniversary of the date that the BBC was officially created and named.As it found its way on air in the early months, there was much in the way of experimentation. Even the first bulletin on 2LO 100 years ago was repeated. That was because bosses asked for it to be read twice, once at normal speed, and then again at half-speed before listeners were asked to say which speed they preferred.Ten decades later, the BBC now has 10 UK-wide  radio networks, a further two national radio services each in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and 39 local radio stations across England and the Channel Islands. That is on top of TV services broadcasting in the UK and around the world and an extensive range of digital services. Subtitles, audio described content and signed content are offered to serve BBC viewers with accessibility needs but, based on that very first piece of viewer feedback in 1922, none of the programmes offer the opportunity to listen back at half-speed.Some of those early radio moments will be rebroadcast from 18:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4 as the station's Six O'Clock News marks exactly 100 years since the evening the BBC first took to the air with its own Centenary Bulletin.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-63583081,/news/entertainment_and_arts
85,My Dad Wrote A Porno podcast to 'go out on a high',"Hit podcast My Dad Wrote a Porno is coming to an end after seven years, six series and two sell-out tours.Three more episodes of the podcast, downloaded more than 430m times and one of the UK's most successful, will be aired before it finishes in December.The show's format sees host Jamie Morton reading chapters of his dad's questionable erotica to his friends James Cooper and Alice Levine.The trio then analyse the writing while often crying with laughter.Speaking to BBC News, the friends said that after scores of episodes it ""felt like the right time"" to bring the podcast series to a close and they ""wanted to go out on a high"", but promised ""it's not the end of the brand"".They added that their individual commitments left them ""worried that the time we could dedicate to it would be limited"".""We were all pretty emotional"" recording the final episode, says Levine, ""but it was satisfying to feel we'd done it proud"".The first episode aired in October 2015 and the racy plot of the Belinda Blinked novels follows protagonist Belinda Blumenthal, a sales executive at Steeles Pots and Pans, in her many trysts as she tries to make it in the cut-throat and debauched industry.Filled with inconsistencies, typos, and incorrect labelling of the female anatomy, the show has been such a hit that it has spawned two sold-out world tours, which have included venues such as the Sydney Opera House and Radio City Music Hall in New York.The live shows were also turned into a comedy special on US channel HBO and the Footnotes spin-off episodes have featured an unending roster of A-list stars.While the podcasts have propelled Morton, Cooper and Levine on to the international stage, the brain behind the books, who writes under the ""nom de porn"" Rocky Flintstone, has remained out of the limelight. However, the final episode will feature an exclusive interview with him. Before that, Belinkers - as fans are known - will get two more chapters in what will bring the increasingly outlandish podcast to a close.While the series will draw to an end, ""it's not the end of the brand"", according to Morton. ""I'm not sure we'll ever do a podcast again as the story came to such a perfect point that we felt we could bow out."" But, adds Levine, there is ""something very exciting in the works. If people are sad about today's news, hopefully they'll be buoyed by this"", with the trio saying an announcement will be coming after Christmas.And if fans cannot wait until then, Flintstone will continue to churn out more of his niche works.The trio remain tight-lipped about where Belinda and her sales expertise could go next. When asked if she could be heading for the screen, Levine replies ""if we did something visual we have a lot of good people on speed dial"", referring to the host of famous faces who've appeared in the spin-off Footnotes episodes - including Dame Emma Thompson, Lin Manuel Miranda and Michael Sheen. The guests were asked which character they would want to play in any adaptation, with the infamous Duchess, who is accompanied by her trusty steed, Toffee Apple Chew, being a favourite.The announcement that the series would be coming to an end was made on social media on Sunday morning, with the MDWAP trio saying it was ""bittersweet"" but ""all bad porn must come to an end"".In a statement they said: ""This show has been the backbone of our lives for the past eight years. ""We've had new jobs, new homes, break ups, breakdowns and a truck load of Chilean Chardonnay.""Speaking to BBC News, they said the ""biggest reward"" of the show had been the community it created.""People have said it helped with their mental health and got them through difficult periods,"" says Cooper.That came through in the social media replies to the show's statement, with fans recalling how the light-hearted nature of the show had got them through ""some very tough times"".For those wanting to re-listen to the laughs and ""get their Belinda fix"", ""the show's not going anywhere"", promises Morton. ""The great thing about podcasting is that your show lives forever.""",,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-63616438,/news/entertainment_and_arts
