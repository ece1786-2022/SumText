It said the close links that existed in Newport \"may prevent the cluster being engaged in future projects relevant to national security\". The Newport plant employs more than 500 people and, at the time of the takeover, was producing about 35,000 wafers a year.The UK government had faced pressure to intervene, not least from the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee which said that Nexperia's takeover represents the sale of \"one of the UK's prized assets\" to a strategic competitor and potentially compromised national security. A report in April said an investigation pledged by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson by the National Security Advisor had not happened.However, the decision was called in by the then-Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng in May on national security grounds.It was left to his successor Grant Shapps to announce the decision following delays due to the changes in prime minister and the cabinet. Nexperia said it did not accept the national security concerns and criticised the UK government for not entering \"meaningful dialogue\". Toni Versluijs, head of its UK operations, said: \"We are genuinely shocked. The decision is wrong, and we will appeal to overturn this divestment order to protect the over 500 jobs at Newport. \"The decision is disproportionate given the remedies Nexperia has proposed. It is wrong for the employees, for the UK semiconductor industry, for the UK economy and for the UK taxpayer - who could now be faced with a bill of over Â£100m for the fallout from this decision.\"We rescued an investment-starved company from collapse. We have repaid taxpayer loans, secured jobs, wages, bonuses and pensions and agreed to spend more than Â£80m on equipment upgrades.

Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade,\" he said.Workers were told that they needed to click on a link by 17:00 EST on Thursday, if they want to be \"part of the new Twitter\".He added: \"Whatever decision you make, thank you for your efforts to make Twitter successful.\"The world's richest man has already announced half of Twitter's staff are being let go, after he bought the company in a $44bn (Â£38.7bn) deal.Mr Musk said he had \"no choice\" over the cuts as the company was losing $4m (Â£3.51m) a day. He has blamed \"activist groups pressuring advertisers\" for a \"massive drop in revenue\".A host of top Twitter executives have also stepped down following his purchase of the firm.Last week, the entrepreneur told Twitter staff that remote working would end and \"difficult times\" lay ahead, according to reports.In an email to staff, the owner of the social media firm said workers would be expected in the office for at least 40 hours a week, Bloomberg reported.Mr Musk added that there was \"no way to sugar coat the message\" that the slowing global economy was going to hit Twitter's advertising revenues.But tech investor Sarah Kunst said the real reason Twitter is facing difficulties is because Mr Musk's takeover has saddled the company with debt. His behaviour since the takeover has also led some advertisers to pause their spending, she said. \"He's now trying to inflict that pain and uncertainty on the employees,\" she said.She added that there was a question mark over how enforceable Mr Musk's email about hours to staff really was.\"Can you just send an email to staff who already work for you, and just unilaterally change their working contract? That remains to be seen.\"Mr Musk himself has been sleeping at Twitter in recent weeks, even while leading electric carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX.He described his work habits in a US court on Wednesday, where he appeared to defend the eye-popping $56bn pay package he received from electric carmaker Tesla in 2018.\"I pretty much work all the time, with rare exceptions.\" he said. In response to questioning, he later added that the \"fundamental organisational restructuring\" at Twitter would be complete by the end of this week.Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, warned it was further evidence that Twitter's culture had \"dramatically changed\" with Mr Musk at the helm.\"Elon Musk is not going to be doing candlelight dinners and playing ping pong in Twitter's cafeteria and this is a shock to the system,\" he said.\"But he also needs to play nice in the sandbox because if key Twitter engineers and developers leave, this will be a major void in the Twitter ecosystem,\" he warned. \"There's a careful balance ahead for him, in this tightrope act.\"Do you work long hours either willingly or because you feel you have no choice?

But he faces a potential backlash from some Tory MPs who oppose big tax hikes. The BBC understands the state pension and benefits will rise with prices but energy support is expected to be scaled back from April. Labour said the country was \"being held back by 12 years of Tory economic failure and wasted opportunities\", with working people \"paying the price\".  The BBC has spoken to people in Whitehall and Parliament about what is likely to be in Mr Hunt's Autumn Statement, although some decisions could change at the last minute.The final figures will be published as the statement is delivered but it is expected that around 55% of the measures will be spending cuts and 45% will be tax rises. This is likely to equate to around Â£30bn in spending cuts and Â£24bn in tax rises. The chancellor is likely to argue that this is not a return to the 2010 Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government's policy of austerity, with the balance of spending cuts to tax rises 80% to 20% under then-Chancellor George Osborne. The government argues the measures are needed to fill a so-called fiscal black hole - the gap between what the government raises and spends.However, some have questioned how reliable the forecasts are and the political decisions ministers are making. The freezing of levels at which people pay various taxes will be a big theme of the statement. As a result of inflation and pay increases, people will end up paying more tax. The threshold when the highest earners start paying the top rate of tax will be lowered to Â£125,000 from Â£150,000. With inflation - the rate at which prices rise - now running at a 41-year high, many departments will see their budgets squeezed with below-inflation increases. But it is expected the health budget will be protected and increase in real terms - even when price rises are taken into account. The government will also save cash by scaling back support with energy bills. The Treasury is likely to say an Energy Price Guarantee will remain in place - but at a higher level. That means millions of households will see their bills go up by hundreds of pounds a year from April.Under the current scheme a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity is expected to pay Â£2,500 annually. This figure is likely to rise to just over Â£3,000 but without the intervention the typical household bill would have hit Â£4,000. Universal support payments will end but there will be targeted support for those on low incomes and pensioners, with the scaling back of the Energy Price Guarantee helping to fund targeted support for some eight million low-income households.The energy industry - including energy generators - will also be hit with a significantly expanded windfall tax to help pay for the support. The BBC understands the state pension and benefits will rise with inflation - although this has not been officially confirmed. An increased National Living Wage, from the current level of Â£9.50 an hour for over-23s, will also be confirmed. After unexpected announcements in Mr Hunt's predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng's ill-fated mini-budget, no big surprises are expected from the chancellor. Mr Hunt has already reversed almost all the tax rises announced in the mini-budget in a bid to stabilise financial markets. Unlike Mr Kwarteng, Mr Hunt will publish independent forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) alongside his statement. The forecasts are expected to paint a grim picture, after the Bank of England warned the country is set for its longest recession since records began.In his Autumn Statement, Mr Hunt is expected to say: \"We are taking difficult decisions to deliver strong public finances and help keep mortgage rates low, but our plan also protects our long-term economic growth.\"At the same time, we protect the vulnerable, because to be British is to be compassionate.\"He is set to add that the UK was not \"immune\" to the global economic crisis \"but with this plan for stability, growth and public services - we will face into the storm\".However, some Tory MPs on the right of the party have already expressed concern about the prospect of tax rises. Former cabinet minister Esther McVey has said putting up taxes is the \"last thing\" a Conservative government should be doing. On Wednesday, she warned she would not support tax rises unless the \"unnecessary vanity project\" of HS2 was scrapped. Simon Clarke, who was in Ms Truss's cabinet, warned Mr Hunt not to \"throw the baby out with the bathwater and overcorrect\" by imposing too many tax hikes.\"I hope they will strike a balance which leans much more to spending reductions than tax rises to balance the books,\" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. But former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb said he feared spending cuts could lead to \"real risks to the quality of public services\".He told the BBC the state pension and benefits \"absolutely\" need to rise with inflation and that the Energy Price Guarantee needed to be broader than just helping pensioners and people on benefits. He added that he was confident Mr Hunt would make \"the right decisions\". Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the UK needed \"fairer choices for working people and a proper plan for growth\". \"Britain has so much potential but we are falling behind on the global stage, while mortgages, food and energy costs all go up and up,\" she said.</td>\n","      <td>Pensions and benefits will rise with prices but energy support is expected to be scaled back, the BBC understands.</td>\n","      <td>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to confirm widespread spending cuts and tax rises .\\nUK is set for its longest recession since records began in 2007 .\\nMinister is expected to say he will reverse almost all the tax rises announced in mini-budget .\\nHe faces potential backlash from some Tory MPs who oppose big tax hikes .</td>\n","      <td>NEW: Prime Minister Jeremy Hunt to confirm spending cuts, tax rises .\\nUK is set for longest recession since records began in 2007, according to forecasts .\\nHe faces potential backlash from some Tories who oppose big tax hikes .\\nNew Living Wage increase due to be confirmed as well as increased National Living Wage .</td>\n","      <td>Jeremy Hunt is expected to confirm widespread spending cuts and tax rises .\\nIndustry industry plans windfall tax increases .\\nMinister to announce cuts in health budget .\\nSome economists question the accuracy of the predictions for growth in April .\\nUK faces recession with record interest rates in February and March .</td>\n","      <td>UK's economic future in recession is still under cloud over inflation .\\nThe finance ministers say policies will keep rising paychecks low or raise the average household rate .\\nPrime Minister: Government plans major cuts, taxes and spending cuts for young-25s .\\nEconomic leaders warn against fiscal overreach .</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>The first sign of job cuts at Amazon came from LinkedIn posts from laid-off employees.Then, Amazon's devices boss, Dave Limp, announced: \"It pains me... We will lose talented Amazonians from the devices &amp; services org\".Across the tech industry, at firms like Twitter, Meta, Coinbase and Snap, workers have announced they are \"seeking new opportunities\".Worldwide, more than 120,000 jobs have been lost, according to the Layoffs.fyi website, which tracks tech job cuts.Different firms cut employees for different reasons but there are common themes.As our lives moved online during the pandemic, the tech giants' businesses boomed, and executives believed the good times - for them - would continue to roll.Meta, for example, took on more than 15,000 people in the first nine months of this year.Now executives announcing cuts have said they miscalculated.\"I made the decision to significantly increase our investments,\" chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees, as he laid off 13% of them.\"Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.\"Online adverts are the chief source of income for many tech firms, but for the advertising business, dark clouds have been gathering. Firms have faced growing opposition to intrusive advertising practices. For example, Apple made it harder to track people's online activity and sell that data to advertisers. And as the economy ran into trouble, many firms slashed their online advertising budgets.In the financial technology sector, rising interest rates have also hit companies.\"It's been a really a disappointing quarter of earnings for many of the big tech companies,\" said technology analyst Paolo Pescatore of PP Foresight. \"No-one's immune.\"Even Apple has signalled caution, with chief executive Tim Cook saying the firm was \"still hiring\", but only on a \"deliberate basis.\" Amazon attributed its job cuts to an \"unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment\" forcing it to prioritize on what mattered most to customers.\"As part of our annual operating planning review process, we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change,\" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. \"As we've gone through this, given the current macro-economic environment (as well as several years of rapid hiring), some teams are making adjustments, which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary. We don't take these decisions lightly, and we are working to support any employees who may be affected.\"Investors have also piled on the pressure to cut costs, accusing firms of being bloated and slow to respond to signs of slowdown.In an open letter to Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, activist investor Sir Christopher Hohn urged the firm to slash jobs and pay.Alphabet had to be more disciplined about costs, he wrote, and cut losses from projects like its self-driving car company, Waymo.Elon Musk is certainly of the view that there is room to cut costs at his latest investment, Twitter, which has struggled to either turn a profit or attract new users.Added to that, many commentators argue Mr Musk paid over the odds for the firm, and the pressure is on to make his investment worthwhile.He laid off half the firm's employees; and for those who remain an \"extreme\" work ethic is promised.According to US media reports on Tuesday, Mr Musk told staff they needed to commit to a \"hardcore\" culture of \"long hours at high intensity\" or leave. Industry watcher Scott Kessler also says there is less tolerance for big spending on high-tech gambles like virtual reality or driverless cars that may not pay off in the short term.Investors also see the high wages and cushy perks some enjoy in the industry as unsustainable.\"Some companies have had to face harsh realities,\" he said.Mike Morini, from WorkForce Software, which provides digital management tools said it appeared to be a turning point.\"The tech industry is exiting a period of growth at all costs,\" he said.But while the big tech firms may be buffeted by economic headwinds, they are not broken.Amazon's proposed 10,000 job cuts in corporate and technology roles - its biggest such reduction to date - represents only 3% of its office staff.And the lay-offs may also be the start of new businesses as talented staff, dumped by the big firms, join or create start-ups.As veteran Silicon Valley watcher Mike Malone recently told the BBC: \"I won't write the Valley off yet.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it was hitting poorer households hardest, as they spent around half of their income on food and energy, compared to about a third for those on middle incomes.October's overall inflation rate, of 11.1%, is the highest for 41 years and up from 10.1% in September.The latest figures come ahead of Thursday's Autumn Statement, in which Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce billions of pounds worth of public spending cuts and tax rises.Mr Hunt said his plans would aim to bring spiralling price rises under control, adding that he would take \"tough but necessary decisions\" to get the economy back on track.But Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the surging inflation rate would \"strike more fear in the heart of families across Britain\" and blamed \"12 years of Tory economic failure\".Inflation is a measure of the cost of living and to calculate it, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) keeps track of the prices of hundreds of everyday items, known as a \"basket of goods\".The ONS said that food prices had risen sharply in October with milk, pasta, margarine, eggs and cereals all going up.I've been conducting a very unscientific experiment by buying the same 10 basic items in Aldi almost every month since May, and yesterday's bill was another increase.My shopping list of exactly the same bread, pizza, chips, loo roll, eggs, potatoes, sugar, oats, cornflakes, and nappies has gone up from Â£14.20 in May to Â£16.29 yesterday. That's a 14.7% rise in just six months.It gives a real sense of what we're all facing at the tills, wherever you shop, and also gives a little glimpse into what the November figures will show us when they are published next month. If anyone was hoping for a reduction in food inflation then it doesn't seem like it's happening just yet.However, gas and electricity prices were still the main drivers of inflation after bills climbed again last month.The government's Energy Price Guarantee scheme did mitigate those rises, limiting the average household bill to around Â£2,500 a year. But the ONS said gas and electricity prices were still up by nearly 130% and 66% respectively compared with a year ago.Without the government's support, however, it said overall inflation would have risen to as high as 13.8%. Greg Pilley is the founder of the Stroud Brewery &amp; Taproom in Gloucestershire, which supplies beer to pubs and shops. He told the BBC his business has been hit by a 10% rise in costs. \"Electricity has doubled over the last year,\" he said. \"We're paying Â£70,000 a year compared to Â£30,000 in the previous year, but also raw materials are going up by between 10-15%.\"He said he'd had to put his prices up, while he was also paying much more in wages.\"The future is fairly unpredictable,\" Mr Pilley said. \"We've got to sell three times as much beer... just to stay in the same place.\" Energy and food prices have been rising since last year because of the war in Ukraine and the impact of the Covid pandemic. Rising prices have led to workers across a number of sectors calling for pay increases in line with the higher cost of living, with some industries such as the railways, staging strikes.How are you being affected by the rising cost of living? Do you have any questions you'd like our experts to answer? Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.However, some economists suggest October's 11.1% inflation rate could be the peak.Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said prices could begin to slow down \"if the government continues to freeze [energy] prices in some way\".\"There is growing evidence that the upward pressure on core inflation from global factors is now fading,\" he added.Dame Deanne Julius, former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee which sets interest rates, also said some of the elements driving inflation - aside from energy bills and food prices - were stabilising.If inflation falls, it won't mean prices will come down, it means prices will rise at a slower rate.The Bank of England has put up interest rates to 3% in a bid to cool inflation. It hopes that by making borrowing money more expensive, people will spend less, demand will decrease and the pace of price rises will be curbed.But higher rates are driving up the cost of mortgages and other loans. The squeeze on spending is dragging on the UK economy which is likely to enter a recession at the end of the year.Latest figures showed the economy contracted by 0.2% between July and September and the Bank of England has warned the UK is facing a tough two-year downturn.A recession is defined as when an economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row. It's a sign an economy is performing badly, with companies often making less money and unemployment rising. Countries around the world are experiencing higher inflation. The rate in Germany is higher than in the UK, at 11.6%, while prices rose by 7.7% in the year to October in the US.However, the UK is performing worse economically than other major nations, with its economy smaller than it was before the Covid pandemic.Additional reporting by Ramzan Karmali.</td>\n","      <td>High prices are hitting poorer people hardest, as they spend more of their income on food and energy.</td>\n","      <td>Food prices are rising at their fastest rate for 45 years, with the cost of basics such as milk, cheese and eggs surging .\\nFood price inflation hit 16.2% in the year to October, up from 14.5% in September .\\nGovernment's Energy Price Guarantee scheme did mitigate those rises .</td>\n","      <td>Food prices are rising at their fastest rate for 45 years, with the cost of basics like milk, cheese and eggs soaring .\\nFood prices rise at the highest rate in 41 years .\\nGovernment's Energy Price Guarantee scheme did mitigate the rises .\\nEnergy and food prices have been rising since last year .</td>\n","      <td>Food prices hit highest level in 45 years, according to new figures .\\nFood prices were the highest in 41 years .\\nEnergy and food prices were also rising sharply .\\nGovernment's energy and fuel guarantees rises, but consumers struggle to pay extra .\\nOnflation rises amid war, inflationary pressures, despite lower energy costs .</td>\n","      <td>Inflation rises to one of last few rises of this type in UK's population .\\nAgency says food price inflation hit 14.1% year to month .\\nIt has caused inflation to rise across Britain and with food rising .\\nOutperformer says he lost more than 7% to raise his price in October .</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>Britain may well have seen the peak in the actual inflation number.

But there is much fear about what happens when winter hits in earnest.October was always going to be a very tough month for figures on the cost of living. Despite the Energy Price Guarantee, inflation at 11.1% is at a 41-year high. Without the guarantee, which limits the rise of typical bills to Â£2,500, it could have been more like 13%.But consumers don't need to be told how wide-ranging this is, with food price inflation up again to the highest rate in 45 years, driven by the cost of things like milk and cheese.In Gloucester Market, the packs of 12 Christmas cards that normally cost Â£1, which were recently pushed up to Â£1.50, are now selling at Â£1.99.And yet in global markets there are the smallest signs that the initial reasons behind the spike in inflation a year ago, post-pandemic supply chain problems, are starting to turn. It can be seen most clearly in the used car market, which was among the very first harbingers of the broken supply chain inflation spike, and is now leading the falls.

It said the close links that existed in Newport \"may prevent the cluster being engaged in future projects relevant to national security\". The Newport plant employs more than 500 people and, at the time of the takeover, was producing about 35,000 wafers a year.The UK government had faced pressure to intervene, not least from the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee which said that Nexperia's takeover represents the sale of \"one of the UK's prized assets\" to a strategic competitor and potentially compromised national security. A report in April said an investigation pledged by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson by the National Security Advisor had not happened.However, the decision was called in by the then-Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng in May on national security grounds.It was left to his successor Grant Shapps to announce the decision following delays due to the changes in prime minister and the cabinet. Nexperia said it did not accept the national security concerns and criticised the UK government for not entering \"meaningful dialogue\". Toni Versluijs, head of its UK operations, said: \"We are genuinely shocked. The decision is wrong, and we will appeal to overturn this divestment order to protect the over 500 jobs at Newport. \"The decision is disproportionate given the remedies Nexperia has proposed. It is wrong for the employees, for the UK semiconductor industry, for the UK economy and for the UK taxpayer - who could now be faced with a bill of over Â£100m for the fallout from this decision.\"We rescued an investment-starved company from collapse.

He has blamed \"activist groups pressuring advertisers\" for a \"massive drop in revenue\".A host of top Twitter executives have also stepped down following his purchase of the firm.Last week, the entrepreneur told Twitter staff that remote working would end and \"difficult times\" lay ahead, according to reports.In an email to staff, the owner of the social media firm said workers would be expected in the office for at least 40 hours a week, Bloomberg reported.Mr Musk added that there was \"no way to sugar coat the message\" that the slowing global economy was going to hit Twitter's advertising revenues.But tech investor Sarah Kunst said the real reason Twitter is facing difficulties is because Mr Musk's takeover has saddled the company with debt. His behaviour since the takeover has also led some advertisers to pause their spending, she said. \"He's now trying to inflict that pain and uncertainty on the employees,\" she said.She added that there was a question mark over how enforceable Mr Musk's email about hours to staff really was.\"Can you just send an email to staff who already work for you, and just unilaterally change their working contract? That remains to be seen.\"Mr Musk himself has been sleeping at Twitter in recent weeks, even while leading electric carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX.He described his work habits in a US court on Wednesday, where he appeared to defend the eye-popping $56bn pay package he received from electric carmaker Tesla in 2018.\"I pretty much work all the time, with rare exceptions.\" he said. In response to questioning, he later added that the \"fundamental organisational restructuring\" at Twitter would be complete by the end of this week.Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, warned it was further evidence that Twitter's culture had \"dramatically changed\" with Mr Musk at the helm.\"Elon Musk is not going to be doing candlelight dinners and playing ping pong in Twitter's cafeteria and this is a shock to the system,\" he said.\"But he also needs to play nice in the sandbox because if key Twitter engineers and developers leave, this will be a major void in the Twitter ecosystem,\" he warned. \"There's a careful balance ahead for him, in this tightrope act.\"Do you work long hours either willingly or because you feel you have no choice?

But he faces a potential backlash from some Tory MPs who oppose big tax hikes. The BBC understands the state pension and benefits will rise with prices but energy support is expected to be scaled back from April. Labour said the country was \"being held back by 12 years of Tory economic failure and wasted opportunities\", with working people \"paying the price\".  The BBC has spoken to people in Whitehall and Parliament about what is likely to be in Mr Hunt's Autumn Statement, although some decisions could change at the last minute.The final figures will be published as the statement is delivered but it is expected that around 55% of the measures will be spending cuts and 45% will be tax rises. This is likely to equate to around Â£30bn in spending cuts and Â£24bn in tax rises. The chancellor is likely to argue that this is not a return to the 2010 Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government's policy of austerity, with the balance of spending cuts to tax rises 80% to 20% under then-Chancellor George Osborne. The government argues the measures are needed to fill a so-called fiscal black hole - the gap between what the government raises and spends.However, some have questioned how reliable the forecasts are and the political decisions ministers are making. The freezing of levels at which people pay various taxes will be a big theme of the statement. As a result of inflation and pay increases, people will end up paying more tax. The threshold when the highest earners start paying the top rate of tax will be lowered to Â£125,000 from Â£150,000. With inflation - the rate at which prices rise - now running at a 41-year high, many departments will see their budgets squeezed with below-inflation increases. But it is expected the health budget will be protected and increase in real terms - even when price rises are taken into account. The government will also save cash by scaling back support with energy bills. The Treasury is likely to say an Energy Price Guarantee will remain in place - but at a higher level. That means millions of households will see their bills go up by hundreds of pounds a year from April.Under the current scheme a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity is expected to pay Â£2,500 annually. This figure is likely to rise to just over Â£3,000 but without the intervention the typical household bill would have hit Â£4,000. Universal support payments will end but there will be targeted support for those on low incomes and pensioners, with the scaling back of the Energy Price Guarantee helping to fund targeted support for some eight million low-income households.The energy industry - including energy generators - will also be hit with a significantly expanded windfall tax to help pay for the support. The BBC understands the state pension and benefits will rise with inflation - although this has not been officially confirmed. An increased National Living Wage, from the current level of Â£9.50 an hour for over-23s, will also be confirmed. After unexpected announcements in Mr Hunt's predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng's ill-fated mini-budget, no big surprises are expected from the chancellor. Mr Hunt has already reversed almost all the tax rises announced in the mini-budget in a bid to stabilise financial markets. Unlike Mr Kwarteng, Mr Hunt will publish independent forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) alongside his statement. The forecasts are expected to paint a grim picture, after the Bank of England warned the country is set for its longest recession since records began.In his Autumn Statement, Mr Hunt is expected to say: \"We are taking difficult decisions to deliver strong public finances and help keep mortgage rates low, but our plan also protects our long-term economic growth.\"At the same time, we protect the vulnerable, because to be British is to be compassionate.\"He is set to add that the UK was not \"immune\" to the global economic crisis \"but with this plan for stability, growth and public services - we will face into the storm\".However, some Tory MPs on the right of the party have already expressed concern about the prospect of tax rises. Former cabinet minister Esther McVey has said putting up taxes is the \"last thing\" a Conservative government should be doing. On Wednesday, she warned she would not support tax rises unless the \"unnecessary vanity project\" of HS2 was scrapped. Simon Clarke, who was in Ms Truss's cabinet, warned Mr Hunt not to \"throw the baby out with the bathwater and overcorrect\" by imposing too many tax hikes.\"I hope they will strike a balance which leans much more to spending reductions than tax rises to balance the books,\" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. But former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb said he feared spending cuts could lead to \"real risks to the quality of public services\".He told the BBC the state pension and benefits \"absolutely\" need to rise with inflation and that the Energy Price Guarantee needed to be broader than just helping pensioners and people on benefits. He added that he was confident Mr Hunt would make \"the right decisions\".

We will lose talented Amazonians from the devices &amp; services org\".Across the tech industry, at firms like Twitter, Meta, Coinbase and Snap, workers have announced they are \"seeking new opportunities\".Worldwide, more than 120,000 jobs have been lost, according to the Layoffs.fyi website, which tracks tech job cuts.Different firms cut employees for different reasons but there are common themes.As our lives moved online during the pandemic, the tech giants' businesses boomed, and executives believed the good times - for them - would continue to roll.Meta, for example, took on more than 15,000 people in the first nine months of this year.Now executives announcing cuts have said they miscalculated.\"I made the decision to significantly increase our investments,\" chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees, as he laid off 13% of them.\"Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.\"Online adverts are the chief source of income for many tech firms, but for the advertising business, dark clouds have been gathering. Firms have faced growing opposition to intrusive advertising practices. For example, Apple made it harder to track people's online activity and sell that data to advertisers. And as the economy ran into trouble, many firms slashed their online advertising budgets.In the financial technology sector, rising interest rates have also hit companies.\"It's been a really a disappointing quarter of earnings for many of the big tech companies,\" said technology analyst Paolo Pescatore of PP Foresight. \"No-one's immune.\"Even Apple has signalled caution, with chief executive Tim Cook saying the firm was \"still hiring\", but only on a \"deliberate basis.\" Amazon attributed its job cuts to an \"unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment\" forcing it to prioritize on what mattered most to customers.\"As part of our annual operating planning review process, we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change,\" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. \"As we've gone through this, given the current macro-economic environment (as well as several years of rapid hiring), some teams are making adjustments, which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary. We don't take these decisions lightly, and we are working to support any employees who may be affected.\"Investors have also piled on the pressure to cut costs, accusing firms of being bloated and slow to respond to signs of slowdown.In an open letter to Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, activist investor Sir Christopher Hohn urged the firm to slash jobs and pay.Alphabet had to be more disciplined about costs, he wrote, and cut losses from projects like its self-driving car company, Waymo.Elon Musk is certainly of the view that there is room to cut costs at his latest investment, Twitter, which has struggled to either turn a profit or attract new users.Added to that, many commentators argue Mr Musk paid over the odds for the firm, and the pressure is on to make his investment worthwhile.He laid off half the firm's employees; and for those who remain an \"extreme\" work ethic is promised.According to US media reports on Tuesday, Mr Musk told staff they needed to commit to a \"hardcore\" culture of \"long hours at high intensity\" or leave. Industry watcher Scott Kessler also says there is less tolerance for big spending on high-tech gambles like virtual reality or driverless cars that may not pay off in the short term.Investors also see the high wages and cushy perks some enjoy in the industry as unsustainable.\"Some companies have had to face harsh realities,\" he said.Mike Morini, from WorkForce Software, which provides digital management tools said it appeared to be a turning point.\"The tech industry is exiting a period of growth at all costs,\" he said.But while the big tech firms may be buffeted by economic headwinds, they are not broken.Amazon's proposed 10,000 job cuts in corporate and technology roles - its biggest such reduction to date - represents only 3% of its office staff.And the lay-offs may also be the start of new businesses as talented staff, dumped by the big firms, join or create start-ups.As veteran Silicon Valley watcher Mike Malone recently told the BBC: \"I won't write the Valley off yet.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said it was hitting poorer households hardest, as they spent around half of their income on food and energy, compared to about a third for those on middle incomes.October's overall inflation rate, of 11.1%, is the highest for 41 years and up from 10.1% in September.The latest figures come ahead of Thursday's Autumn Statement, in which Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce billions of pounds worth of public spending cuts and tax rises.Mr Hunt said his plans would aim to bring spiralling price rises under control, adding that he would take \"tough but necessary decisions\" to get the economy back on track.But Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the surging inflation rate would \"strike more fear in the heart of families across Britain\" and blamed \"12 years of Tory economic failure\".Inflation is a measure of the cost of living and to calculate it, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) keeps track of the prices of hundreds of everyday items, known as a \"basket of goods\".The ONS said that food prices had risen sharply in October with milk, pasta, margarine, eggs and cereals all going up.I've been conducting a very unscientific experiment by buying the same 10 basic items in Aldi almost every month since May, and yesterday's bill was another increase.My shopping list of exactly the same bread, pizza, chips, loo roll, eggs, potatoes, sugar, oats, cornflakes, and nappies has gone up from Â£14.20 in May to Â£16.29 yesterday. That's a 14.7% rise in just six months.It gives a real sense of what we're all facing at the tills, wherever you shop, and also gives a little glimpse into what the November figures will show us when they are published next month. If anyone was hoping for a reduction in food inflation then it doesn't seem like it's happening just yet.However, gas and electricity prices were still the main drivers of inflation after bills climbed again last month.The government's Energy Price Guarantee scheme did mitigate those rises, limiting the average household bill to around Â£2,500 a year. But the ONS said gas and electricity prices were still up by nearly 130% and 66% respectively compared with a year ago.Without the government's support, however, it said overall inflation would have risen to as high as 13.8%. Greg Pilley is the founder of the Stroud Brewery &amp; Taproom in Gloucestershire, which supplies beer to pubs and shops. He told the BBC his business has been hit by a 10% rise in costs. \"Electricity has doubled over the last year,\" he said. \"We're paying Â£70,000 a year compared to Â£30,000 in the previous year, but also raw materials are going up by between 10-15%.\"He said he'd had to put his prices up, while he was also paying much more in wages.\"The future is fairly unpredictable,\" Mr Pilley said. \"We've got to sell three times as much beer... just to stay in the same place.\" Energy and food prices have been rising since last year because of the war in Ukraine and the impact of the Covid pandemic. Rising prices have led to workers across a number of sectors calling for pay increases in line with the higher cost of living, with some industries such as the railways, staging strikes.How are you being affected by the rising cost of living?

Share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.However, some economists suggest October's 11.1% inflation rate could be the peak.Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said prices could begin to slow down \"if the government continues to freeze [energy] prices in some way\".\"There is growing evidence that the upward pressure on core inflation from global factors is now fading,\" he added.Dame Deanne Julius, former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee which sets interest rates, also said some of the elements driving inflation - aside from energy bills and food prices - were stabilising.If inflation falls, it won't mean prices will come down, it means prices will rise at a slower rate.The Bank of England has put up interest rates to 3% in a bid to cool inflation. It hopes that by making borrowing money more expensive, people will spend less, demand will decrease and the pace of price rises will be curbed.But higher rates are driving up the cost of mortgages and other loans. The squeeze on spending is dragging on the UK economy which is likely to enter a recession at the end of the year.Latest figures showed the economy contracted by 0.2% between July and September and the Bank of England has warned the UK is facing a tough two-year downturn.A recession is defined as when an economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row. It's a sign an economy is performing badly, with companies often making less money and unemployment rising. Countries around the world are experiencing higher inflation. The rate in Germany is higher than in the UK, at 11.6%, while prices rose by 7.7% in the year to October in the US.However, the UK is performing worse economically than other major nations, with its economy smaller than it was before the Covid pandemic.Additional reporting by Ramzan Karmali.</td>\n","      <td>High prices are hitting poorer people hardest, as they spend more of their income on food and energy.</td>\n","      <td>Food prices are rising at their fastest rate for 45 years, with the cost of basics such as milk, cheese and eggs surging .\\nFood price inflation hit 16.2% in the year to October, up from 14.5% in September .\\nGovernment's Energy Price Guarantee scheme did mitigate those rises .</td>\n","      <td>Food prices are rising at their fastest rate for 45 years, with the cost of basics such as milk, cheese and eggs surging .\\nFood prices have risen at their highest rate for 41 years, up from 14.5% in September .\\nEnergy and food prices have been rising since last year because of the war in Ukraine .</td>\n","      <td>Food prices are rising at their fastest rate for 45 years .\\nMainly due to lower energy and fuel prices .\\nUK's energy and food prices have risen sharply in past year .\\nConsumer groups report rising costs, especially bread, chips, sugar, cornflakes, nappies .\\nThe ONS keeps track of the prices of thousands of everyday items .</td>\n","      <td>Food inflation hits high 16.2% year-to-month levels as more people put to work .\\nIncrease rises in overall price due to falling energy and gas prices .\\nSummer has seen a decrease in energy prices, as many businesses go into the dumps .\\nUK is meeting a UK budget for the next two years and the unemployment rate rises to a four-year high .</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>Britain may well have seen the peak in the actual inflation number. We are nowhere near the peak of the impact on society and households.Even in the leafy Gloucestershire Cotswolds, where there always have been pockets of deprivation, I was repeatedly told that people were simply not putting their heating on, with impacts on their health.That might have been manageable up until now, thanks to the unusually mild winter, which has also helped calm the international market prices for gas and electricity. But there is much fear about what happens when winter hits in earnest.October was always going to be a very tough month for figures on the cost of living. Despite the Energy Price Guarantee, inflation at 11.1% is at a 41-year high. Without the guarantee, which limits the rise of typical bills to Â£2,500, it could have been more like 13%.But consumers don't need to be told how wide-ranging this is, with food price inflation up again to the highest rate in 45 years, driven by the cost of things like milk and cheese.In Gloucester Market, the packs of 12 Christmas cards that normally cost Â£1, which were recently pushed up to Â£1.50, are now selling at Â£1.99.And yet in global markets there are the smallest signs that the initial reasons behind the spike in inflation a year ago, post-pandemic supply chain problems, are starting to turn. It can be seen most clearly in the used car market, which was among the very first harbingers of the broken supply chain inflation spike, and is now leading the falls. The more relaxed approach to China's \"zero Covid\" lockdowns has also meant there is some light at the end of the tunnel about prices.Energy remains tough, but much will depend on tomorrow's announcements from the chancellor at his Autumn Statement. I expect that we will hear not just about a more targeted scheme of support, but also about the rollover of some of the welfare-related support schemes that were due to end in April under Liz Truss' plans.But undoubtedly some above-average households, that do not consider themselves to be \"rich\", will be facing less protection from the cold winds of the international energy markets and the war in Ukraine.So prices will stay very high for a few months at least, as it takes some time for these global factors to feed into everyday prices.</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>Britain may well have seen the peak in the actual inflation number last year .\\nHowever, there is much fear about what happens when winter hits in earnest .\\nPrices will stay very high for a few months at least, as it takes some time for global factors to feed into everyday prices .</td>\n","      <td>Britain may have seen the peak in inflation in the first half of the year .\\nHowever, there is still a lot of fear about what happens when winter hits in earnest .\\nFood inflation is up again, driven by the cost of things like milk and cheese .\\nThere is still some light at the end of the tunnel about prices .</td>\n","      <td>Food prices have risen again this month, driven by increased milk and cheese costs .\\nInflation has jumped in excess of 11.1% in the UK despite its energy price guarantee .\\nWe have to take a tough look at how the impact is affecting the lives of the people who live there .</td>\n","      <td>Britain had its longest monthly average annual inflation spike of 22 years, according to UK.\\nMost of this has due to extra household costs, although inflation has dropped off a little .\\nEconomists hope cuts are not enough to keep food inflation healthy, but that new cuts in spending cuts are starting to make up for .\\nI also hope UK's chancellor gets a boost from a more targeted program towards helping poor .</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>"]},"metadata":{}}]}]}
