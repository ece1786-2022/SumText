It said the close links that existed in Newport \"may prevent the cluster being engaged in future projects relevant to national security\". The Newport plant employs more than 500 people and, at the time of the takeover, was producing about 35,000 wafers a year.The UK government had faced pressure to intervene, not least from the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee which said that Nexperia's takeover represents the sale of \"one of the UK's prized assets\" to a strategic competitor and potentially compromised national security. A report in April said an investigation pledged by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson by the National Security Advisor had not happened.However, the decision was called in by the then-Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng in May on national security grounds.It was left to his successor Grant Shapps to announce the decision following delays due to the changes in prime minister and the cabinet. Nexperia said it did not accept the national security concerns and criticised the UK government for not entering \"meaningful dialogue\". Toni Versluijs, head of its UK operations, said: \"We are genuinely shocked. The decision is wrong, and we will appeal to overturn this divestment order to protect the over 500 jobs at Newport. \"The decision is disproportionate given the remedies Nexperia has proposed. It is wrong for the employees, for the UK semiconductor industry, for the UK economy and for the UK taxpayer - who could now be faced with a bill of over Â£100m for the fallout from this decision.\"We rescued an investment-starved company from collapse. We have repaid taxpayer loans, secured jobs, wages, bonuses and pensions and agreed to spend more than Â£80m on equipment upgrades. The deal was publicly welcomed by the Welsh government.\"</td>\n","      <td>Nexperia must sell 86% of its stake to mitigate security risk .\\nThe deal came under scrutiny amid an ongoing shortage of computer chips .\\nFirms said they would appeal to overturn decision .\\nNewport plant employs more than 500 people, employs 35,000 wafers a year .</td>\n","      <td>Nexperia must sell 86% of its stake to mitigate security risk .\\nThe deal came under scrutiny amid an ongoing shortage of computer chips .\\nFirms said they would appeal to overturn decision .\\nNewport plant employs more than 500 people, employs 35,000 wafers a year .</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Elon Musk has told Twitter staff that they must commit to working \"long hours at high intensity\" or else leave the company, according to reports.In an email to staff, the social media firm's new owner said workers should agree to the pledge if they wanted to stay, the Washington Post reported.Those who do not sign up by Thursday will be given three months' severance pay, Mr Musk said.The BBC has contacted Twitter for comment.In his email to staff, also seen by The Guardian, Mr Musk said that Twitter \"will need to be extremely hardcore\" in order to succeed.\"This will mean working long hours at high intensity. Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade,\" he said.Workers were told that they needed to click on a link by 17:00 EST on Thursday, if they want to be \"part of the new Twitter\".He added: \"Whatever decision you make, thank you for your efforts to make Twitter successful.\"The world's richest man has already announced half of Twitter's staff are being let go, after he bought the company in a $44bn (Â£38.7bn) deal.Mr Musk said he had \"no choice\" over the cuts as the company was losing $4m (Â£3.51m) a day. He has blamed \"activist groups pressuring advertisers\" for a \"massive drop in revenue\".A host of top Twitter executives have also stepped down following his purchase of the firm.Last week, the entrepreneur told Twitter staff that remote working would end and \"difficult times\" lay ahead, according to reports.In an email to staff, the owner of the social media firm said workers would be expected in the office for at least 40 hours a week, Bloomberg reported.Mr Musk added that there was \"no way to sugar coat the message\" that the slowing global economy was going to hit Twitter's advertising revenues.But tech investor Sarah Kunst said the real reason Twitter is facing difficulties is because Mr Musk's takeover has saddled the company with debt. His behaviour since the takeover has also led some advertisers to pause their spending, she said. \"He's now trying to inflict that pain and uncertainty on the employees,\" she said.She added that there was a question mark over how enforceable Mr Musk's email about hours to staff really was.\"Can you just send an email to staff who already work for you, and just unilaterally change their working contract? That remains to be seen.\"Mr Musk himself has been sleeping at Twitter in recent weeks, even while leading electric carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX.He described his work habits in a US court on Wednesday, where he appeared to defend the eye-popping $56bn pay package he received from electric carmaker Tesla in 2018.\"I pretty much work all the time, with rare exceptions.\" he said. In response to questioning, he later added that the \"fundamental organisational restructuring\" at Twitter would be complete by the end of this week.Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, warned it was further evidence that Twitter's culture had \"dramatically changed\" with Mr Musk at the helm.\"Elon Musk is not going to be doing candlelight dinners and playing ping pong in Twitter's cafeteria and this is a shock to the system,\" he said.\"But he also needs to play nice in the sandbox because if key Twitter engineers and developers leave, this will be a major void in the Twitter ecosystem,\" he warned. \"There's a careful balance ahead for him, in this tightrope act.\"Do you work long hours either willingly or because you feel you have no choice?

But he faces a potential backlash from some Tory MPs who oppose big tax hikes. The BBC understands the state pension and benefits will rise with prices but energy support is expected to be scaled back from April. Labour said the country was \"being held back by 12 years of Tory economic failure and wasted opportunities\", with working people \"paying the price\".  The BBC has spoken to people in Whitehall and Parliament about what is likely to be in Mr Hunt's Autumn Statement, although some decisions could change at the last minute.The final figures will be published as the statement is delivered but it is expected that around 55% of the measures will be spending cuts and 45% will be tax rises. This is likely to equate to around Â£30bn in spending cuts and Â£24bn in tax rises. The chancellor is likely to argue that this is not a return to the 2010 Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government's policy of austerity, with the balance of spending cuts to tax rises 80% to 20% under then-Chancellor George Osborne. The government argues the measures are needed to fill a so-called fiscal black hole - the gap between what the government raises and spends.However, some have questioned how reliable the forecasts are and the political decisions ministers are making. The freezing of levels at which people pay various taxes will be a big theme of the statement. As a result of inflation and pay increases, people will end up paying more tax. The threshold when the highest earners start paying the top rate of tax will be lowered to Â£125,000 from Â£150,000. With inflation - the rate at which prices rise - now running at a 41-year high, many departments will see their budgets squeezed with below-inflation increases. But it is expected the health budget will be protected and increase in real terms - even when price rises are taken into account. The government will also save cash by scaling back support with energy bills. The Treasury is likely to say an Energy Price Guarantee will remain in place - but at a higher level. That means millions of households will see their bills go up by hundreds of pounds a year from April.Under the current scheme a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity is expected to pay Â£2,500 annually. This figure is likely to rise to just over Â£3,000 but without the intervention the typical household bill would have hit Â£4,000. Universal support payments will end but there will be targeted support for those on low incomes and pensioners, with the scaling back of the Energy Price Guarantee helping to fund targeted support for some eight million low-income households.The energy industry - including energy generators - will also be hit with a significantly expanded windfall tax to help pay for the support. The BBC understands the state pension and benefits will rise with inflation - although this has not been officially confirmed. An increased National Living Wage, from the current level of Â£9.50 an hour for over-23s, will also be confirmed. After unexpected announcements in Mr Hunt's predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng's ill-fated mini-budget, no big surprises are expected from the chancellor. Mr Hunt has already reversed almost all the tax rises announced in the mini-budget in a bid to stabilise financial markets. Unlike Mr Kwarteng, Mr Hunt will publish independent forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) alongside his statement. The forecasts are expected to paint a grim picture, after the Bank of England warned the country is set for its longest recession since records began.In his Autumn Statement, Mr Hunt is expected to say: \"We are taking difficult decisions to deliver strong public finances and help keep mortgage rates low, but our plan also protects our long-term economic growth.\"At the same time, we protect the vulnerable, because to be British is to be compassionate.\"He is set to add that the UK was not \"immune\" to the global economic crisis \"but with this plan for stability, growth and public services - we will face into the storm\".However, some Tory MPs on the right of the party have already expressed concern about the prospect of tax rises. Former cabinet minister Esther McVey has said putting up taxes is the \"last thing\" a Conservative government should be doing. On Wednesday, she warned she would not support tax rises unless the \"unnecessary vanity project\" of HS2 was scrapped. Simon Clarke, who was in Ms Truss's cabinet, warned Mr Hunt not to \"throw the baby out with the bathwater and overcorrect\" by imposing too many tax hikes.\"I hope they will strike a balance which leans much more to spending reductions than tax rises to balance the books,\" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. But former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb said he feared spending cuts could lead to \"real risks to the quality of public services\".He told the BBC the state pension and benefits \"absolutely\" need to rise with inflation and that the Energy Price Guarantee needed to be broader than just helping pensioners and people on benefits. He added that he was confident Mr Hunt would make \"the right decisions\". Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the UK needed \"fairer choices for working people and a proper plan for growth\". \"Britain has so much potential but we are falling behind on the global stage, while mortgages, food and energy costs all go up and up,\" she said.</td>\n","      <td>UK chancellor to announce widespread cuts, tax rises in Autumn Statement .\\nPM says government needs to fight soaring price rises, cutting tax and spending .\\nGovernment has reversed all the tax rises announced in the last budget .\\nSome Tories fear social stability will be threatened by tax rises .</td>\n","      <td>UK chancellor to announce widespread cuts, tax rises in Autumn Statement .\\nPM says government needs to fight soaring price rises, cutting tax and spending .\\nGovernment has reversed all the tax rises announced in the last budget .\\nSome Tories fear social stability will be threatened by tax rises .</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>The first sign of job cuts at Amazon came from LinkedIn posts from laid-off employees.Then, Amazon's devices boss, Dave Limp, announced: \"It pains me... We will lose talented Amazonians from the devices &amp; services org\".Across the tech industry, at firms like Twitter, Meta, Coinbase and Snap, workers have announced they are \"seeking new opportunities\".Worldwide, more than 120,000 jobs have been lost, according to the Layoffs.fyi website, which tracks tech job cuts.Different firms cut employees for different reasons but there are common themes.As our lives moved online during the pandemic, the tech giants' businesses boomed, and executives believed the good times - for them - would continue to roll.Meta, for example, took on more than 15,000 people in the first nine months of this year.Now executives announcing cuts have said they miscalculated.\"I made the decision to significantly increase our investments,\" chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees, as he laid off 13% of them.\"Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.\"Online adverts are the chief source of income for many tech firms, but for the advertising business, dark clouds have been gathering. Firms have faced growing opposition to intrusive advertising practices. For example, Apple made it harder to track people's online activity and sell that data to advertisers. And as the economy ran into trouble, many firms slashed their online advertising budgets.In the financial technology sector, rising interest rates have also hit companies.\"It's been a really a disappointing quarter of earnings for many of the big tech companies,\" said technology analyst Paolo Pescatore of PP Foresight. \"No-one's immune.\"Even Apple has signalled caution, with chief executive Tim Cook saying the firm was \"still hiring\", but only on a \"deliberate basis.\" Amazon attributed its job cuts to an \"unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment\" forcing it to prioritize on what mattered most to customers.\"As part of our annual operating planning review process, we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change,\" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. \"As we've gone through this, given the current macro-economic environment (as well as several years of rapid hiring), some teams are making adjustments, which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary. We don't take these decisions lightly, and we are working to support any employees who may be affected.\"Investors have also piled on the pressure to cut costs, accusing firms of being bloated and slow to respond to signs of slowdown.In an open letter to Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, activist investor Sir Christopher Hohn urged the firm to slash jobs and pay.Alphabet had to be more disciplined about costs, he wrote, and cut losses from projects like its self-driving car company, Waymo.Elon Musk is certainly of the view that there is room to cut costs at his latest investment, Twitter, which has struggled to either turn a profit or attract new users.Added to that, many commentators argue Mr Musk paid over the odds for the firm, and the pressure is on to make his investment worthwhile.He laid off half the firm's employees; and for those who remain an \"extreme\" work ethic is promised.According to US media reports on Tuesday, Mr Musk told staff they needed to commit to a \"hardcore\" culture of \"long hours at high intensity\" or leave. Industry watcher Scott Kessler also says there is less tolerance for big spending on high-tech gambles like virtual reality or driverless cars that may not pay off in the short term.Investors also see the high wages and cushy perks some enjoy in the industry as unsustainable.\"Some companies have had to face harsh realities,\" he said.Mike Morini, from WorkForce Software, which provides digital management tools said it appeared to be a turning point.\"The tech industry is exiting a period of growth at all costs,\" he said.But while the big tech firms may be buffeted by economic headwinds, they are not broken.Amazon's proposed 10,000 job cuts in corporate and technology roles - its biggest such reduction to date - represents only 3% of its office staff.And the lay-offs may also be the start of new businesses as talented staff, dumped by the big firms, join or create start-ups.As veteran Silicon Valley watcher Mike Malone recently told the BBC: \"I won't write the Valley off yet. I still have a lot of hope.\"</td>\n","      <td>A number of companies are announcing job cuts .\\nExecutives blamed for sluggish economy and rising interest rates .\\nApple had to be more disciplined about costs, warned of slowdown .\\nElon Musk said Twitter and others should spend more on virtual reality .\\nWall Street analysts and others are skeptical about the impact on the job market .</td>\n","      <td>A number of companies are announcing job cuts .\\nExecutives blamed for sluggish economy and rising interest rates .\\nApple had to be more disciplined about costs, warned of slowdown .\\nElon Musk said Twitter and others should spend more on virtual reality .\\nWall Street analysts and others are skeptical about the impact on the job market .</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>UK-based food delivery app Deliveroo says it is quitting Australia, citing tough economic conditions.The company's Australian operation, which launched in 2015, is being placed into voluntary administration.Deliveroo has come under increasing pressure to treat its 15,000 riders as employees, with the country's new government pledging to improve gig workers' conditions. It has also faced competition from rivals such as Uber Eats and Menulog.Deliveroo said it had stopped accepting orders through its app, with customers receiving an error message if they tried to place an order.\"This was a difficult decision and not one we have taken lightly. We want to thank all our employees, consumers, riders and restaurant and grocery partners who have been involved with the Australian operations over the past seven years,\" Deliveroo's chief operating officer Eric French said in a statement to investors.\"Our focus is now on making sure our employees, riders and partners are supported throughout this process,\" he added.In the statement the company pledged \"guaranteed enhanced severance payments for employees as well as compensation for riders and for certain restaurant partners.\"Food delivery apps saw demand surge during the pandemic but have since faced challenges including customers reining in their spending and the tightening of regulations in several countries.During Australia's election campaign this year Anthony Albanese, who is now the country's prime minister, said he would work to improve the rights of workers if his party came to power.Members of his government have called gig work a \"cancer\" on the economy with accusations that it drives down the wages of a million workers.

It said the close links that existed in Newport \"may prevent the cluster being engaged in future projects relevant to national security\". The Newport plant employs more than 500 people and, at the time of the takeover, was producing about 35,000 wafers a year.The UK government had faced pressure to intervene, not least from the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee which said that Nexperia's takeover represents the sale of \"one of the UK's prized assets\" to a strategic competitor and potentially compromised national security. A report in April said an investigation pledged by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson by the National Security Advisor had not happened.However, the decision was called in by the then-Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng in May on national security grounds.It was left to his successor Grant Shapps to announce the decision following delays due to the changes in prime minister and the cabinet. Nexperia said it did not accept the national security concerns and criticised the UK government for not entering \"meaningful dialogue\". Toni Versluijs, head of its UK operations, said: \"We are genuinely shocked. The decision is wrong, and we will appeal to overturn this divestment order to protect the over 500 jobs at Newport. \"The decision is disproportionate given the remedies Nexperia has proposed. It is wrong for the employees, for the UK semiconductor industry, for the UK economy and for the UK taxpayer - who could now be faced with a bill of over Â£100m for the fallout from this decision.\"We rescued an investment-starved company from collapse.

He has blamed \"activist groups pressuring advertisers\" for a \"massive drop in revenue\".A host of top Twitter executives have also stepped down following his purchase of the firm.Last week, the entrepreneur told Twitter staff that remote working would end and \"difficult times\" lay ahead, according to reports.In an email to staff, the owner of the social media firm said workers would be expected in the office for at least 40 hours a week, Bloomberg reported.Mr Musk added that there was \"no way to sugar coat the message\" that the slowing global economy was going to hit Twitter's advertising revenues.But tech investor Sarah Kunst said the real reason Twitter is facing difficulties is because Mr Musk's takeover has saddled the company with debt. His behaviour since the takeover has also led some advertisers to pause their spending, she said. \"He's now trying to inflict that pain and uncertainty on the employees,\" she said.She added that there was a question mark over how enforceable Mr Musk's email about hours to staff really was.\"Can you just send an email to staff who already work for you, and just unilaterally change their working contract?

But he faces a potential backlash from some Tory MPs who oppose big tax hikes. The BBC understands the state pension and benefits will rise with prices but energy support is expected to be scaled back from April. Labour said the country was \"being held back by 12 years of Tory economic failure and wasted opportunities\", with working people \"paying the price\".  The BBC has spoken to people in Whitehall and Parliament about what is likely to be in Mr Hunt's Autumn Statement, although some decisions could change at the last minute.The final figures will be published as the statement is delivered but it is expected that around 55% of the measures will be spending cuts and 45% will be tax rises. This is likely to equate to around Â£30bn in spending cuts and Â£24bn in tax rises. The chancellor is likely to argue that this is not a return to the 2010 Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government's policy of austerity, with the balance of spending cuts to tax rises 80% to 20% under then-Chancellor George Osborne. The government argues the measures are needed to fill a so-called fiscal black hole - the gap between what the government raises and spends.However, some have questioned how reliable the forecasts are and the political decisions ministers are making. The freezing of levels at which people pay various taxes will be a big theme of the statement. As a result of inflation and pay increases, people will end up paying more tax. The threshold when the highest earners start paying the top rate of tax will be lowered to Â£125,000 from Â£150,000. With inflation - the rate at which prices rise - now running at a 41-year high, many departments will see their budgets squeezed with below-inflation increases. But it is expected the health budget will be protected and increase in real terms - even when price rises are taken into account. The government will also save cash by scaling back support with energy bills. The Treasury is likely to say an Energy Price Guarantee will remain in place - but at a higher level. That means millions of households will see their bills go up by hundreds of pounds a year from April.Under the current scheme a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity is expected to pay Â£2,500 annually. This figure is likely to rise to just over Â£3,000 but without the intervention the typical household bill would have hit Â£4,000. Universal support payments will end but there will be targeted support for those on low incomes and pensioners, with the scaling back of the Energy Price Guarantee helping to fund targeted support for some eight million low-income households.The energy industry - including energy generators - will also be hit with a significantly expanded windfall tax to help pay for the support. The BBC understands the state pension and benefits will rise with inflation - although this has not been officially confirmed. An increased National Living Wage, from the current level of Â£9.50 an hour for over-23s, will also be confirmed. After unexpected announcements in Mr Hunt's predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng's ill-fated mini-budget, no big surprises are expected from the chancellor. Mr Hunt has already reversed almost all the tax rises announced in the mini-budget in a bid to stabilise financial markets. Unlike Mr Kwarteng, Mr Hunt will publish independent forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) alongside his statement. The forecasts are expected to paint a grim picture, after the Bank of England warned the country is set for its longest recession since records began.In his Autumn Statement, Mr Hunt is expected to say: \"We are taking difficult decisions to deliver strong public finances and help keep mortgage rates low, but our plan also protects our long-term economic growth.\"At the same time, we protect the vulnerable, because to be British is to be compassionate.\"He is set to add that the UK was not \"immune\" to the global economic crisis \"but with this plan for stability, growth and public services - we will face into the storm\".However, some Tory MPs on the right of the party have already expressed concern about the prospect of tax rises. Former cabinet minister Esther McVey has said putting up taxes is the \"last thing\" a Conservative government should be doing. On Wednesday, she warned she would not support tax rises unless the \"unnecessary vanity project\" of HS2 was scrapped. Simon Clarke, who was in Ms Truss's cabinet, warned Mr Hunt not to \"throw the baby out with the bathwater and overcorrect\" by imposing too many tax hikes.\"I hope they will strike a balance which leans much more to spending reductions than tax rises to balance the books,\" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. But former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb said he feared spending cuts could lead to \"real risks to the quality of public services\".He told the BBC the state pension and benefits \"absolutely\" need to rise with inflation and that the Energy Price Guarantee needed to be broader than just helping pensioners and people on benefits. He added that he was confident Mr Hunt would make \"the right decisions\". Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the UK needed \"fairer choices for working people and a proper plan for growth\". \"Britain has so much potential but we are falling behind on the global stage, while mortgages, food and energy costs all go up and up,\" she said.</td>\n","      <td>chancellor jeremy hunt will pledge to face into the economic storm , as he is expected to confirm

We will lose talented Amazonians from the devices &amp; services org\".Across the tech industry, at firms like Twitter, Meta, Coinbase and Snap, workers have announced they are \"seeking new opportunities\".Worldwide, more than 120,000 jobs have been lost, according to the Layoffs.fyi website, which tracks tech job cuts.Different firms cut employees for different reasons but there are common themes.As our lives moved online during the pandemic, the tech giants' businesses boomed, and executives believed the good times - for them - would continue to roll.Meta, for example, took on more than 15,000 people in the first nine months of this year.Now executives announcing cuts have said they miscalculated.\"I made the decision to significantly increase our investments,\" chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees, as he laid off 13% of them.\"Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.\"Online adverts are the chief source of income for many tech firms, but for the advertising business, dark clouds have been gathering. Firms have faced growing opposition to intrusive advertising practices. For example, Apple made it harder to track people's online activity and sell that data to advertisers. And as the economy ran into trouble, many firms slashed their online advertising budgets.In the financial technology sector, rising interest rates have also hit companies.\"It's been a really a disappointing quarter of earnings for many of the big tech companies,\" said technology analyst Paolo Pescatore of PP Foresight. \"No-one's immune.\"Even Apple has signalled caution, with chief executive Tim Cook saying the firm was \"still hiring\", but only on a \"deliberate basis.\" Amazon attributed its job cuts to an \"unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment\" forcing it to prioritize on what mattered most to customers.\"As part of our annual operating planning review process, we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change,\" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. \"As we've gone through this, given the current macro-economic environment (as well as several years of rapid hiring), some teams are making adjustments, which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary. We don't take these decisions lightly, and we are working to support any employees who may be affected.\"Investors have also piled on the pressure to cut costs, accusing firms of being bloated and slow to respond to signs of slowdown.In an open letter to Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, activist investor Sir Christopher Hohn urged the firm to slash jobs and pay.Alphabet had to be more disciplined about costs, he wrote, and cut losses from projects like its self-driving car company, Waymo.Elon Musk is certainly of the view that there is room to cut costs at his latest investment, Twitter, which has struggled to either turn a profit or attract new users.Added to that, many commentators argue Mr Musk paid over the odds for the firm, and the pressure is on to make his investment worthwhile.He laid off half the firm's employees; and for those who remain an \"extreme\" work ethic is promised.According to US media reports on Tuesday, Mr Musk told staff they needed to commit to a \"hardcore\" culture of \"long hours at high intensity\" or leave. Industry watcher Scott Kessler also says there is less tolerance for big spending on high-tech gambles like virtual reality or driverless cars that may not pay off in the short term.Investors also see the high wages and cushy perks some enjoy in the industry as unsustainable.\"Some companies have had to face harsh realities,\" he said.Mike Morini, from WorkForce Software, which provides digital management tools said it appeared to be a turning point.\"The tech industry is exiting a period of growth at all costs,\" he said.But while the big tech firms may be buffeted by economic headwinds, they are not broken.Amazon's proposed 10,000 job cuts in corporate and technology roles - its biggest such reduction to date - represents only 3% of its office staff.And the lay-offs may also be the start of new businesses as talented staff, dumped by the big firms, join or create start-ups.As veteran Silicon Valley watcher Mike Malone recently told the BBC: \"I won't write the Valley off yet.
